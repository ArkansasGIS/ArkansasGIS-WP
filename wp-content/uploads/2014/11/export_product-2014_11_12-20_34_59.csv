<div class=""md"" style=""color: #000000;""><b style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Purpose: </b>The Geographic Names Information System contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries. The database assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. The GNIS collects data from a broad program of partnerships with Federal, State, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The GNIS provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map and feature services, file download services, and customized files upon request.</div>

The Board serves all government agencies and the public as the central authority to which name inquiries, name issues, and new name proposals can be directed. It is comprised of representatives of Federal agencies associated with land management and cartography. Sharing its responsibilities with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board develops principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of both domestic and foreign geographic names as well as undersea and Antarctic feature names.</div>

The following landing facilities have been excluded: private landing                         facilities not open to the public, glider ports and ultra light landing                         facilities, as well as landing facilities that do not have a current LOCID                         assigned to them. Horizontal positional accuracy is based on coordinate data                         provided in the NFDC 5010 database. These coordinate data identify the                         approximate location of the Airport Reference Point (ARP) as reported by the                         landing facility on the NFDC 5010 form. According to NFDC guidelines, the                         location of the ARP should be reported to a horizontal accuracy of one arc                         second of latitude and longitude. However, the accuracy of these reported                         coordinates are not verified by FAA. The scale is unknown.

This data set contains Functional Classification roads for the State of                         Arkansas per the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). This                         file should only be used as a graphical representation and for general                         reporting. Field verification and source contact should always occur prior                         to financial planning taking place. Functional classification is the process                         by which streets and highways are grouped into classes, or systems,                         according to the character of service they are intended to provide. Basic to                         this process is the recognition that individual roads and streets do not                         serve travel independently in any major way. Rather, most travel involves                         movement through a network of roads. It becomes necessary then to determine                         how this travel can be channelized within the network in a logical and                         efficient manner. Functional classification defines the nature of this                         channelization process by defining the part that any particular road or                         street should play in serving the flow of trips through a highway                         network.

Roman Catholic Churches In Large Cities in Arkansas This dataset                         includes buildings where Roman Catholics gather for organized worship in                         cities with a population of 50,000 people or more. Roman Catholic Churches                         are Christian Churches that are subject to the papal authority in Rome. In                         addition to what are commonly thought of as Roman Catholic Churches, this                         data set also includes Newman (or Neumann) Centers and Chaldean Churches.                         Newman Centers are Roman Catholic Churches setup specifically to serve                         college or university populations. The Chaldean Church (also known as the                         Chaldean Church of Babylon) reunited with the Catholic Church in the 15th                         century. It originated in the Middle East. If a group of Roman Catholics                         gather for organized worship at a location that also serves another                         function, such as a school, these locations are included in this dataset if                         they otherwise meet the criteria for inclusion. Roman Catholic Shrines are                         included if they hold regularly scheduled mass. If a congregation celebrates                         mass at multiple locations, we have tried to include all such locations.                         This dataset excludes churches that are not subject to papal authority in                         Rome. Some churches may refer to themselves as ""Catholic"", and yet not be                         part of the ""Roman"" Catholic Church and these Churches are excluded from                         this dataset. Specifically Protestant Churches and their descendants which                         separated from the Roman Catholic Church beginning in 1517, Eastern Orthodox                         Churches (e.g. Russian, Greek) which separated from the Roman Catholic                         Church in 1054, and Episcopalian (Church of England in America) which                         separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 are excluded. The 22                         ""Eastern Catholic autonomous particular churches"", with the exception of the                         Chaldean Church, are also excluded. These are Churches which are in full                         communion with the Pope in Rome, but which practice their own rites which                         are different from the Western or Latin Roman Catholic Church. This dataset                         excludes rectories. Private homes, even if they are used for formal worship,                         are excluded from this dataset. Locations that are only used for                         administrative purposes are also excluded. This dataset also includes                         original TGS research. All data is non license restricted data. TGS has                         ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations.                         Therefore all entities in this dataset were “verified” using alternative                         reference sources, such as topo maps, parcel maps, various sources of                         imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) attribute for                         these entities has been set to “ALT REF”. Text fields in this dataset have                         been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search                         results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have                         been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate                         use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

Large Protestant Churches in Arkansas The Large Protestant Churches                         dataset is composed of any type of building where Protestant Christians                         congregate as an organization to worship. In cases where membership or                         attendance figures were available, churches were selected for inclusion that                         had 750 or more members or attendees. In cases where such figures were not                         available, churches were selected based upon the population of the city that                         appears in their address. In this case, only churches in cities with 100,000                         or more population were included. The Protestant Churches dataset should not                         include Non Christian, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Russian Orthodox,                         Greek Orthodox and related churches of their descendants that split from the                         Roman Catholic church. Also not included in this dataset are homes of church                         representatives, schools and any type of administrative buildings. This                         dataset is comprised entirely of non licensed restricted data that was                         obtained through TGS original research.

The                         [CONTHOW] (contact how) attribute for these entities has been set to “ALT                         REF”. The text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to                         facilitate consistent database engine search results. Non printable and                         control characters were removed from all text fields. All diacritics (e.g.                         the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their                         closest equivalent English character.

Law Enforcement Locations in Arkansas Any location where sworn                         officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or stationed. Law                         Enforcement agencies ""are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time                         or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers"". This is the                         definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice                         Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative                         Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non Federal                         Agencies, this dataset includes locations for Federal, state, local, and                         special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law Enforcement agencies                         include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state                         police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement                         agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged                         with law enforcement (e.g. US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional                         authorities (e.g. Port Authority Police). Although TGS' intention is to only                         include locations associated with agencies that meet the above definition,                         TGS has discovered a few locations that are associated with agencies that                         are not publicly funded. TGS is deleting these locations as we become aware                         of them, but some probably still exist in this dataset. Generally the                         requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are                         set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or                         licensed by their state. County, city and other government authorities                         within each state are generally empowered by their state law to setup or                         disband Law Enforcement agencies. Never the less, the agencies have                         visibility to state level authorities because generally sworn Law                         Enforcement officers must report to the state the agency they are employed                         by. TGS did not verify any state attributes, only the name, physical street                         address, city, state, five digit zip code, phone number and location were                         verified through phone contact. At the request of NGA, text fields in this                         dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database                         engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g. the                         German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest                         equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that                         may not support diacritics.

Dams within the State                         of Arkansas fall under a permit process established under Arkansas Code                         15-22-201. All dams with height of 25 or more feet and containing 50                         acre-feet or more of storage at normal pool must have a valid construction                         and operation permit from the Commission, unless they are owned by the                         United States Government. If smaller dams pose a threat to life or property,                         they may also require regulation by the State based on a petition by                         downstream landowners and results of a public hearing. Dams are defined as:                         Any barrier, including one for flood detention, designed to impound liquid                         volumes. This shall not include highway, railroad or other roadway                         embankments, including low water crossings that may temporarily detain                         floodwater, levees designed to prevent inundation by floodwater, or closed                         dikes to temporarily impound liquids in the event of emergencies and those                         barriers not exempt by Sections 701.3 or 701.4 of TITLE VII RULES GOVERNING                         DESIGN AND OPERATION OF DAMS [As Restated October, 1993]

Jails and Prisons (Correctional Institutions) in Arkansas The Jails and                         Prisons sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the                         Critical Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility                         or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against                         their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and                         juvenile detention facilities, as well as law enforcement temporary holding                         facilities. Work camps, including camps operated seasonally, are included if                         they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal Prison is a facility operated                         by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration of individuals. A                         State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or territory                         of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer                         than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the                         incarceration of those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually                         18 years). A Local Jail is a locally administered facility that holds                         inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72 hours) and is staffed by municipal or                         county employees. A temporary holding facility, sometimes referred to as a                         ""police lock up"" or ""drunk tank"", is a facility used to detain people prior                         to arraignment. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded                         from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent with that used by                         the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their ""National Jail Census"", with the                         exception of ""temporary holding facilities"", which the DOJ excludes. If the                         facility is enclosed with a fence, wall, or structure with a gate around the                         buildings only, the locations were depicted as ONENTITY at the entrance. If                         the facility's buildings are not enclosed, the locations were depicted as                         ONENTITY on the building or BLOCKFACE on the correct street segment.                         Personal homes, administrative offices and temporary locations are intended                         to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be included. Personal homes                         of constables may exist due to the fact that many constables work out of                         their home. With the merge of the Law Enforcement and the Correctional                         Institutions datasets, the NAICS Descriptions were assigned based on the                         facility's main function, which were determined by the entity's name,                         facility type, web research and state supplied data. For records where the                         entity's name represents both datasets, the NAICS Description was assigned                         based on the specifications of the dataset the record is assigned to. Text                         fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate                         consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German                         umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest                         equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that                         may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by                         the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates                         from 2006/06/28 and the newest record dates from 2008/02/19

The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. The ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.

A ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTA) is a statistical geographic entity                         that approximates the delivery area for a U.S. Postal Service five-digit or                         three-digit ZIP Code.

The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.

The                         primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution,                         quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude)                         image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the                         North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is                         equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum                         of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary                         and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal                         matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary                         datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and                         samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west                         to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric                         image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to                         255. This dataset is a combination of all DOQ images from the State of                         Arkansas. They have been stitched into a single mosaic through an automated                         process using ER Mapper software from Earth Resource Mapping Pty Ltd. The                         DOQ images were contrast balanced (using histogram matching) and the                         resulting balanced mosaic was forced into a value range of 0 to 255 using a                         simple linear transformation.

Data available online through GeoStor at                         http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. These data can be used in a geographic                         information system (GIS) for any number of purposes such as assessing                         wildlife habitat, water quality, pesticide runoff, land use change, etc. The                         State data sets are provided with a 300 meter buffer beyond the State border                         to facilitate combining the State files into larger regions. The user must                         have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the                         resulting limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was                         compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial                         resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where                         available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was                         conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to                         18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs                         for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted                         from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments                         (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of                         contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the                         state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known                         only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are                         cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient                         reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local                         analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents                         conditions in the early 1990s. The Arkansas portion of the NLCD was created                         as part of a project area encompassing portions of Federal Region VI,                         including the states of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and                         Arkansas. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover                         categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as                         a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S.                         Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover                         data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic                         mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization                         (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies                         that produce or use land cover data. Partners include the USGS (National                         Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources Divisions), US EPA, the                         U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                         Administration.

The collarless hillshaded DRGs are hillshaded using the National                         Elevation Dataset (NED). The NED is a raster product assembled by the U.S.                         Geological Survey. NED is designed to provide National elevation data in a                         seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data                         corrections were made in the NED assembly process to minimize artifacts,                         perform edge matching, and fill sliver areas of missing data. NED has a                         resolution of one arc-second (approximately 30 meters) for the continuous                         United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. They are the same                         resolution as the 1:24,000 collarless DRGs, which has an approximate cell                         size of 2.4 meters, but hillshaded to give the maps a three-dimensional                         perspective. The collarless hillshade DRGs were created using a sequence of                         programs developed by Robert Weih.

The Digital Geologic Quadrangle Maps (DGM) series is a collection of                         geologic maps produced at a 1:24,000 scale. Most of these maps were produced                         in cooperation with the USGS through Cooperative Geologic Mapping Programs.                         Each map contains geologic formation contacts, fault, structure, and                         attitude of bedding (strike and dip) data at a 1:24,000 scale. Also included                         on most of the maps are a cross-section, correlation and description of map                         units, references, and a stratigraphic column for the                         quadrangle.

This open-file report presents the results of the USGS Mineral                         Resources Program activity to compile a national-scale geologic map database                         to support national and regional level projects, including mineral resource                         and geo-environmental assessments. The only comprehensive sources of                         regional- and national-scale geologic maps are state geologic maps with                         scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000. Digital versions of these                         state maps form the core of what is presented here. Because no adequate                         geologic map exists for the state of Alaska, it is being compiled in                         regional blocks that also form part of this national database. It is                         expected that this series will completed by approximately the end of 2007.                         These maps and databases are being released in blocks of states or, in the                         case of Alaska, as compiled blocks of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles as                         chapters in this series. For Alaska, formal maps as well as databases are                         being published here, whereas for the conterminous U.S. only state databases                         and preview graphics are presented, because published maps for most states                         already exist. For Alaska these regional compilations will form the base for                         compiling a new geologic map of the state. As documented in Chapter A,                         standards for the conterminous U.S. are somewhat different than those for                         Alaska and Hawaii.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the                         type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to                         serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and                         monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. By recognizing the                         spatial differences in the capacities and potentials of ecosystems,                         ecoregions stratify the environment by its probable response to disturbance                         (Bryce, Omernik, and Larsen, 1999). Ecoregions are general purpose regions                         that are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management                         strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment                         organizations that are responsible for different types of resources in the                         same geographical areas (Omernik and others, 2000). A Roman numeral                         hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels of ecological                         regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15                         ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions                         (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At level                         III, the continental United States contains 104 ecoregions and the                         conterminous United States has 84 ecoregions (U.S. Environmental Protection                         Agency [USEPA], 2003). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of level                         III ecoregions. Methods used to define the USEPA's ecoregions are explained                         in Omernik (1995), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).                         The approach used to compile the ecoregions of Arkansas is based on the                         premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of                         the spatial patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic                         characteristics that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and                         integrity (Wiken, 1986; Omernik, 1987, 1995). These characteristics include                         geology, physiography, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, fish, hydrology,                         and vegetation (including ""potential natural vegetation"" defined by Küchler                         (p. 2, 1964) as ""vegetation that would exist today"" if human influence ended                         and ""the resulting plant succession"" was ""telescoped into a single moment"").                         The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological                         region to another regardless of ecoregion hierarchical level. In Arkansas,                         there are 7 level III ecoregions and 32 level IV ecoregions; all but four of                         these level IV ecoregions are also found in ecologically similar parts of                         adjacent states (Chapman and others, 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Griffith, Omernik,                         and Azevedo, 1998). Arkansas' ecological diversity is strongly related to                         regional physiography, geology, soil, climate, and land use. Elevated karst                         plateaus, folded mountains, agricultural valleys, forested uplands, and                         bottomland forests occur. Fire-maintained prairie was once extensive in                         several parts of the state. The ecoregion were compiled at a scale of                         1:250,000, and depict revisions and subdivisions of earlier level III                         ecoregions that were originally compiled at a smaller scale (U.S.                         Environmental Protection Agency, 2003; Omernik, 1987). It is part of a                         collaborative project primarily between USEPA Region 6, USEPA-National                         Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (Corvallis, Oregon),                         and the Multi-Agency Wetland Planning Team (MAWPT), which comprises                         representatives of six Arkansas state agencies (Arkansas Natural Heritage                         Commission, Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Arkansas Game                         and Fish Commission, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas                         Forestry Commission, and University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension                         Service). Collaboration and consultation also occurred with the U.S. Army                         Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources                         Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Fish and                         Wildlife Service, USGS-Earth Resources Observation Systems Data Center, and                         University of Arkansas-Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies. This                         project is associated with an interagency effort to develop a common                         framework of ecological regions (McMahon and others, 2001). Reaching that                         objective requires recognition of the differences in the conceptual                         approaches and mapping methodologies applied to develop the most common                         ecoregion-type frameworks, including those developed by the U.S. Department                         of Agriculture-Forest Service (Bailey and others, 1994), the USEPA (Omernik                         1987, 1995), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Soil Conservation                         Service (1981). As each of these frameworks is further refined, their                         differences are becoming less discernible. Each collaborative ecoregion                         project, such as this one in Arkansas, is a step toward attaining consensus                         and consistency in ecoregion frameworks for the entire nation. Comments and                         questions regarding the Level III and IV Ecoregions of Arkansas should be                         addressed to Alan Woods, Oregon State University, c/o US EPA., 200 SW 35th                         Street, Corvallis, OR 97333, (541) 754-4469, email: woods.alan@epa.gov, or                         to James Omernik, USGS, c/o US EPA, 200 SW 35th Street, Corvallis, OR 97333,                         (541) 754-4458, email: omernik.james@epa.gov

The Nature Conservancy’s vision is to conserve portfolios of functional                         conservation areas within and across ecoregions. Through this portfolio                         approach, we will work with partners to conserve a full array of ecosystems                         and viable native species . An ecoregional portfolio, the end product of                         ecoregional planning, is a selected set of places that represents the full                         distribution and diversity of native species, natural communities and                         ecosystems in an ecoregion. Designing ecoregion-based portfolios is a                         complex, iterative process based on five steps: * Identifying the species,                         communities and ecosystems in an ecoregion; * Setting specific goals for the                         number and distribution of these conservation targets to be captured in the                         portfolio; * Assembling information and relevant data on the location and                         quality of conservation targets; * Designing a network of conservation areas                         that most effectively meets the goals; and * Identifying the highest                         priority conservation areas, wide-ranging targets and pervasive threats for                         conservation action.

Data available online through GeoStor at                         http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The Hillshade (Shaded Relief) dataset is a                         derived product from the USGS National Elevation Dataset. The U.S.                         Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Database (NED). The NED                         is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute                         elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial                         source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data,                         efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts                         in the existing data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill                         slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED                         processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating                         slope and hydrologic derivatives.

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a representation of the topography of                         the Earth surface in digital format. The data is made up of sampled arrays                         of pixels depicting surface elevations in raster form. This data was                         captured as an ancillary product of a statewide ortho image acquisition                         using a Lecia ADS40 sensor. The primary DEM is a 5-meter ground resolution,                         quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude)                         cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North                         American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DEM is                         equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over edge ranges from a minimum                         of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary                         and secondary corner points. The over edge is included to facilitate for the                         placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. This series of                         DEM's was produced as a part of the 2006 Arkansas Digital Orthophotography                         Program administered by the Arkansas State Land Information Board and the                         Arkansas Geographic Information Office. The aerial imaging data used to                         create the DEM was acquired between January 15th and March 31st in                         2006.

Data available online through GeoStor at                         http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The product is a mosaic of 10 meter posting                         (10- by 10-m data spacing) DEMs covering the National Forest. Input data for                         the production of the mosaic consisted of the10 meter posting DEMs, in                         standard USGS format, required to provide coverage of the National Forest.                         The mosaic is available in ERDAS Imagine .img format (version 8.5) and ESRI                         GRID format. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by the                         USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster form. The                         standard USGS format DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a                         designated coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series                         of profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each                         profile is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data                         is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered                         from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. Each                         standard USGS DEM provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute                         quadrangle without over edge.

Data available online through GeoStor at                         http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a                         National Elevation Database (NED). The NED is a seamless mosaic of                         best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the                         conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition                         to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing                         methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data,                         convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at                         quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a                         much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic                         derivatives.

Most BGs were delineated by local participants                         in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The                         Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to                         delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP                         participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract                         contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.                         Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or                         census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic                         entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts,                         congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native                         Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were                         intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in                         territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census                         2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or                         out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some                         census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census                         Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these                         offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract                         areas.

The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf)                         that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from                         the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated                         Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB                         represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts,                         however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent                         data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups                         (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are                         clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first                         digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.                         For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within                         Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.                         Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an                         optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants                         in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The                         Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to                         delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP                         participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract                         contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.                         Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or                         census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic                         entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts,                         congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native                         Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were                         intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in                         territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census                         2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or                         out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some                         census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census                         Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these                         offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract                         areas.

The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected                         geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The                         geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical                         equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available                         governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a                         seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each                         county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent                         data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.

The files                         contain information distributed over a series of record types for the                         spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic                         data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be                         used with appropriate software to prepare maps.

A Survey System is a named or numbered area of land that can be                         identified by a type and a designator. The survey system is generally a                         simultaneous conveyance that defines an area of land within which there is a                         consistent method of land description. The survey systems included lands                         that were established prior to PLSS survey and were not included in the                         public domain lands.

Special Surveys are non-rectangular PLSS survey areas from BLM survey                         records. These features are not populated for the Ohio data set because at                         the time of the PLSS Surveys in Ohio, the non-rectangular survey types had                         not been established.

This is a graphic representation of the data stewards based on PLSS                         Townships in PLSS areas. In non-PLSS areas the metadata at a glance is based                         on a data steward defined polygons such as a city or county or other units.                         The identification of the data steward is a general indication of the agency                         that will be responsible for updates and providing the authoritative data                         sources.

This dataset contains polygon features representing the approximate                         location of tax parcels contained in County Assessor tax rolls. Individual                         county data was integrated into this statewide publication by the Arkansas                         Geographic Information Office (AGIO). The Computer Aided Mass Appraisal                         (CAMA) systems maintained in each county are used to populate the database                         attributes for each polygon feature. The entity attribute structure conforms                         to the Arkansas Cadastral Mapping Standard. The digital cadastral data is                         provided as a publication version that only represents a snapshot of the                         production data at the time it was received from the county. Published                         updates may be made to counties throughout the year. These will occur after                         new data is digitized or updates to existing data are finished. Production                         versions of the data exist in the various counties where daily and weekly                         updates occur. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to                         determine the age of the data for a given county. This column reflects the                         date when AGIO received the data from the county. Only parcels with an                         associated Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) record are provided. This                         means a CAMA record may exist, but no polygon geometry or vice-versa.                         Cadastral data is dynamic by its nature; therefore it is impossible for any                         county to ever be considered complete. The data is NOT topologically                         enforced. As a statewide integrator, AGIO publishes the data but does not                         make judgment calls about where points or polygon lines are meant to be                         located. Therefore each county data set is published without topology rules                         being enforced. Mappers use best practices such as polygon closure and                         vertex snapping, however, topology is not built for each county. Users                         should be aware, by Arkansas Law (15-21-504 2 B) digital cadastral data does                         not represent legal property boundary descriptions, nor is it suitable for                         boundary determination of the individual parcels included in the cadastre.                         Users requiring a boundary determination should consult an Arkansas                         Registered Land Surveyor on boundary questions. The digital cadastral data                         is intended to be a graphical representation of the tax parcel only. Just                         because a county is listed does NOT imply the data represents county wide                         coverage. AGIO worked with each county to determine a level of production                         that warranted the data was ready to be published. For example, in some                         counties only the north part of the county was covered or in other cases                         only rural parcels are covered and yet in others only urban parcels. The                         approach is to begin incremental publishing as production blocks are ready,                         even though a county may not have county wide coverage. Each case represents                         a significant amount of data that will be useful immediately. Users should                         consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column. This date reflects when the data                         was received from the county. Digital cadastral data users should be aware                         the County Assessor Mapping Program adopted a phased approach for developing                         cadastral data. Phase One includes the production of a parcel centroid for                         each parcel that bears the attributes prescribed by the state cadastral                         mapping standard. Phase Two includes the production of parcel polygon                         geometry and bears the standard attributes. The Arkansas standard closely                         mirrors the federal Cadastral Core Data Standard established by the Federal                         Geographic Data Committee, Subcommittee for Cadastral Data.

Data available online through GeoStor at                         http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. This data set is a digital general soil                         association map developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. It                         consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in                         a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown                         at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing                         more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not                         available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are                         assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images.                         Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent                         of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is                         determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and                         expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This                         data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized                         attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic                         quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil                         map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record                         relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component                         soils and their properties.

This dataset is called the Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database and is                         derived from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is                         generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the                         National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping                         standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived                         from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information                         System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO                         digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents, and adding a                         State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added                         look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10                         meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal                         Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier                         called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster                         cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look                         up (valu) table that contains additional derived data. The value added look                         up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level                         using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of                         most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted                         averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.

NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains, and                         cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also                         identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa                         components that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil                         components where the majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A                         map unit percent composition for earthy major components is provided. See                         Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and M. P. Robotham. 2012.

Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include:                         presence of hard bedrock, soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric                         material, a dense layer, a layer having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer                         having an electrical conductivity of more than 12 within the component soil                         profile. If no root-restricting zone is identified, a depth of 150 cm is                         used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et al., 2012). The map unit                         average available water storage within the root zone depth for major earthy                         components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil landscapes                         comprise those map units that have available water storage within the root                         zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)                         expressed as ""1"" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or ""0"" for                         a nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas                         (includes water bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version                         1) information is given as the percentage of the map unit (all components)                         that meet the criteria for a potential wetland soil landscape. See table                         column (field) description for criteria details. If water was determined to                         account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit, a value of 999 was used to                         indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution, but is helpful to                         identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit sum of the                         component percentage representative values is also provided as useful                         metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data                         are incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete                         data were handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO                         calculations for SOC and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following                         data checking and summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use                         the official data in the SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in                         case there were some data entry errors. However, there were a few exceptions                         to this principle if there was a good reason for a Null value in a critical                         variable, or to accommodate the data coding conventions used in some soil                         surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to the top of the surface                         horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were all okay, then                         the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to zero.If                         the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon                         represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was                         set to equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r =                         hzdept_r), effectively giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC                         or AWS), but not blocking calculation of other horizons in the profile due                         to horizon depth errors.Other types of horizon depth errors were considered                         uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths for the component being set to                         a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component from the analysis. The                         errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the soil profile,                         other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data for                         the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not                         indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values                         were effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the                         values at the map unit level could be an underestimate for some                         soils.Horizon rock fragment considerations:Part of the algorithm for                         calculating the SOC requires finding the volume of soil that is not rock.                         This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate rock fragments                         (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not organic, and                         any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to the                         total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as                         “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is                         organic, then it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was                         made, and default values for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these                         variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0, frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100).                         Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the horizon designator or the                         texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed Plant Material”. If                         all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated more than                         100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero for                         SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation                         because rock content is already accounted for in the available water                         capacity (awc_r) variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component                         summary:To summarize data from the horizon level to the component level, the                         evaluation proceeded downward from the surface. If a valid value for AWS                         could not be calculated for any horizon, then the result for that horizon                         and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was separately                         applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for SOC                         but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data                         from the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages                         must be valid. There are tests both of the individual component percentage                         (comppct_r) data, and also of the sum of the component percentages at the                         map unit level (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following                         rules were applied for the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be                         in the range from 0 to 100, inclusive. 2) Individual components with a                         comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded) were ignored. A zero comppct_r value                         excludes the component from having an effect on the map unit calculation. No                         values more than 100% were found in the data for individual comppct_r.Two                         additional rules were applied for the sum of the component percentages in a                         map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r must be in                         the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was set                         to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With                         these rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or                         SOC compared to what would have been calculated if there were complete data                         and/or no comppct_r errors.Metadata variables: sums of component                         percentages:Several metadata variables are provided in the VALU table to                         help understand when the AWS and SOC values are underestimated because of                         these component percentage issues. The sum of the component percentages for                         the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this is greater than                         100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results will be                         given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the                         soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS                         and SOC values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be                         an underestimate if the unreported soils would have had values for these                         measures.The sums of the component percentages that were used in the AWS and                         SOC calculations are also reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and                         mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values are less than the                         mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient data to                         compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables                         essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of                         an AWS or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as                         bedrock at the surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these                         rules and their implications, including explicit examples, will be given in                         a forthcoming publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA                         NRCS, Lincoln, NE.

This dataset contains the common Map Unit attributes for each polygon                         within the gSSURGO database plus NRCS derived attributes from a data summary                         table called the National Valu Added Look Up (valu) Table #1. It is                         comprised of 57 pre-summarized or ""ready to map"" derived soil survey                         geographic database attributes including soil organic carbon, available                         water storage, crop productivity indices, crop root zone depths, available                         water storage within crop root zone depths, drought vulnerable soil                         landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. Related metadata values                         for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map                         unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the                         needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component                         weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.                         These themes were prepared to better meet the mapping needs of users of soil                         survey information and can be used with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO                         (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database is derived from the                         official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is generally the                         most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National                         Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.                         The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from                         properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information                         System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO                         digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents, and adding a                         State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added                         look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10                         meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal                         Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier                         called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster                         cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look                         up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The                         map unit average Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C                         per square meter for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average                         thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone                         calcuations is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm,                         20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth).                         The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer), o-20cm, 0-30cm,                         0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents the                         soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are                         given in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The                         average thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these                         layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm,                         5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil                         depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm,                         0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents                         the soil surface.The map unit average National Commodity Crop Productivity                         Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low productivity and high                         index values indicate high productivity) are provided for major earthy                         components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains, and                         cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also                         identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa                         components that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil                         components where the majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A                         map unit percent composition for earthy major components is provided. See                         Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and M. P. Robotham. 2012. National                         Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide, Version 2. USDA-NRCS.                         Available at:                         ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit                         average root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters                         for major earthy components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include:                         presence of hard bedrock, soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric                         material, a dense layer, a layer having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer                         having an electrical conductivity of more than 12 within the component soil                         profile. If no root-restricting zone is identified, a depth of 150 cm is                         used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et al., 2012). The map unit                         average available water storage within the root zone depth for major earthy                         components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil landscapes                         comprise those map units that have available water storage within the root                         zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)                         expressed as ""1"" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or ""0"" for                         a nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas                         (includes water bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version                         1) information is given as the percentage of the map unit (all components)                         that meet the criteria for a potential wetland soil landscape. See table                         column (field) description for criteria details. If water was determined to                         account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit, a value of 999 was used to                         indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution, but is helpful to                         identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit sum of the                         component percentage representative values is also provided as useful                         metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data                         are incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete                         data were handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO                         calculations for SOC and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following                         data checking and summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use                         the official data in the SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in                         case there were some data entry errors. However, there were a few exceptions                         to this principle if there was a good reason for a Null value in a critical                         variable, or to accommodate the data coding conventions used in some soil                         surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to the top of the surface                         horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were all okay, then                         the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to zero.If                         the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon                         represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was                         set to equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r =                         hzdept_r), effectively giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC                         or AWS), but not blocking calculation of other horizons in the profile due                         to horizon depth errors.Other types of horizon depth errors were considered                         uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths for the component being set to                         a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component from the analysis. The                         errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the soil profile,                         other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data for                         the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not                         indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values                         were effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the                         values at the map unit level could be an underestimate for some                         soils.Horizon rock fragment considerations:Part of the algorithm for                         calculating the SOC requires finding the volume of soil that is not rock.                         This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate rock fragments                         (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not organic, and                         any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to the                         total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as                         “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is                         organic, then it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was                         made, and default values for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these                         variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0, frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100).                         Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the horizon designator or the                         texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed Plant Material”. If                         all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated more than                         100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero for                         SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation                         because rock content is already accounted for in the available water                         capacity (awc_r) variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component                         summary:To summarize data from the horizon level to the component level, the                         evaluation proceeded downward from the surface. If a valid value for AWS                         could not be calculated for any horizon, then the result for that horizon                         and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was separately                         applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for SOC                         but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data                         from the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages                         must be valid. There are tests both of the individual component percentage                         (comppct_r) data, and also of the sum of the component percentages at the                         map unit level (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following                         rules were applied for the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be                         in the range from 0 to 100, inclusive. 2) Individual components with a                         comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded) were ignored. A zero comppct_r value                         excludes the component from having an effect on the map unit calculation. No                         values more than 100% were found in the data for individual comppct_r.Two                         additional rules were applied for the sum of the component percentages in a                         map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r must be in                         the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was set                         to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With                         these rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or                         SOC compared to what would have been calculated if there were complete data                         and/or no comppct_r errors.Metadata variables: sums of component                         percentages:Several metadata variables are provided in the VALU table to                         help understand when the AWS and SOC values are underestimated because of                         these component percentage issues. The sum of the component percentages for                         the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this is greater than                         100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results will be                         given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the                         soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS                         and SOC values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be                         an underestimate if the unreported soils would have had values for these                         measures.The sums of the component percentages that were used in the AWS and                         SOC calculations are also reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and                         mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values are less than the                         mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient data to                         compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables                         essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of                         an AWS or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as                         bedrock at the surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these                         rules and their implications, including explicit examples, will be given in                         a forthcoming publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA                         NRCS, Lincoln, NE.

This dataset contains the common Map Unit attributes for each polygon                         within the gSSURGO database plus NRCS derived attributes from a data summary                         table called the National Valu Added Look Up (valu) Table #1. It is                         comprised of 57 pre-summarized or ""ready to map"" derived soil survey                         geographic database attributes including soil organic carbon, available                         water storage, crop productivity indices, crop root zone depths, available                         water storage within crop root zone depths, drought vulnerable soil                         landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. Related metadata values                         for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map                         unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the                         needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component                         weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.                         These themes were prepared to better meet the mapping needs of users of soil                         survey information and can be used with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO                         (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database is derived from the                         official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is generally the                         most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National                         Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.                         The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from                         properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information                         System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO                         digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents, and adding a                         State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added                         look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10                         meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal                         Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier                         called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster                         cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look                         up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The                         map unit average Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C                         per square meter for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average                         thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone                         calcuations is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm,                         20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth).                         The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer), o-20cm, 0-30cm,                         0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents the                         soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are                         given in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The                         average thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these                         layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm,                         5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil                         depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm,                         0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents                         the soil surface.The map unit average National Commodity Crop Productivity                         Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low productivity and high                         index values indicate high productivity) are provided for major earthy                         components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains, and                         cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also                         identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa                         components that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil                         components where the majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A                         map unit percent composition for earthy major components is provided. See                         Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and M. P. Robotham. 2012. National                         Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide, Version 2. USDA-NRCS.                         Available at:                         ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit                         average root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters                         for major earthy components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include:                         presence of hard bedrock, soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric                         material, a dense layer, a layer having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer                         having an electrical conductivity of more than 12 within the component soil                         profile. If no root-restricting zone is identified, a depth of 150 cm is                         used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et al., 2012). The map unit                         average available water storage within the root zone depth for major earthy                         components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil landscapes                         comprise those map units that have available water storage within the root                         zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)                         expressed as ""1"" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or ""0"" for                         a nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas                         (includes water bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version                         1) information is given as the percentage of the map unit (all components)                         that meet the criteria for a potential wetland soil landscape. See table                         column (field) description for criteria details. If water was determined to                         account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit, a value of 999 was used to                         indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution, but is helpful to                         identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit sum of the                         component percentage representative values is also provided as useful                         metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data                         are incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete                         data were handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO                         calculations for SOC and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following                         data checking and summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use                         the official data in the SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in                         case there were some data entry errors. However, there were a few exceptions                         to this principle if there was a good reason for a Null value in a critical                         variable, or to accommodate the data coding conventions used in some soil                         surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to the top of the surface                         horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were all okay, then                         the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to zero.If                         the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon                         represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was                         set to equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r =                         hzdept_r), effectively giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC                         or AWS), but not blocking calculation of other horizons in the profile due                         to horizon depth errors.Other types of horizon depth errors were considered                         uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths for the component being set to                         a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component from the analysis. The                         errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the soil profile,                         other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data for                         the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not                         indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values                         were effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the                         values at the map unit level could be an underestimate for some                         soils.Horizon rock fragment considerations:Part of the algorithm for                         calculating the SOC requires finding the volume of soil that is not rock.                         This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate rock fragments                         (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not organic, and                         any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to the                         total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as                         “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is                         organic, then it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was                         made, and default values for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these                         variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0, frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100).                         Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the horizon designator or the                         texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed Plant Material”. If                         all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated more than                         100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero for                         SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation                         because rock content is already accounted for in the available water                         capacity (awc_r) variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component                         summary:To summarize data from the horizon level to the component level, the                         evaluation proceeded downward from the surface. If a valid value for AWS                         could not be calculated for any horizon, then the result for that horizon                         and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was separately                         applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for SOC                         but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data                         from the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages                         must be valid. There are tests both of the individual component percentage                         (comppct_r) data, and also of the sum of the component percentages at the                         map unit level (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following                         rules were applied for the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be                         in the range from 0 to 100, inclusive. 2) Individual components with a                         comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded) were ignored. A zero comppct_r value                         excludes the component from having an effect on the map unit calculation. No                         values more than 100% were found in the data for individual comppct_r.Two                         additional rules were applied for the sum of the component percentages in a                         map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r must be in                         the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was set                         to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With                         these rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or                         SOC compared to what would have been calculated if there were complete data                         and/or no comppct_r errors.Metadata variables: sums of component                         percentages:Several metadata variables are provided in the VALU table to                         help understand when the AWS and SOC values are underestimated because of                         these component percentage issues. The sum of the component percentages for                         the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this is greater than                         100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results will be                         given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the                         soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS                         and SOC values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be                         an underestimate if the unreported soils would have had values for these                         measures.The sums of the component percentages that were used in the AWS and                         SOC calculations are also reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and                         mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values are less than the                         mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient data to                         compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables                         essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of                         an AWS or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as                         bedrock at the surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these                         rules and their implications, including explicit examples, will be given in                         a forthcoming publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA                         NRCS, Lincoln, NE.

This dataset contains the common Map Unit attributes for each polygon                         within the gSSURGO database plus NRCS derived attributes from a data summary                         table called the National Valu Added Look Up (valu) Table #1. It is                         comprised of 57 pre-summarized or ""ready to map"" derived soil survey                         geographic database attributes including soil organic carbon, available                         water storage, crop productivity indices, crop root zone depths, available                         water storage within crop root zone depths, drought vulnerable soil                         landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. Related metadata values                         for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map                         unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the                         needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component                         weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.                         These themes were prepared to better meet the mapping needs of users of soil                         survey information and can be used with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO                         (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database is derived from the                         official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is generally the                         most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National                         Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.                         The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from                         properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information                         System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO                         digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents, and adding a                         State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added                         look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10                         meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal                         Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier                         called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster                         cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look                         up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The                         map unit average Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C                         per square meter for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average                         thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone                         calcuations is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm,                         20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth).                         The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer), o-20cm, 0-30cm,                         0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents the                         soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are                         given in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The                         average thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these                         layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm,                         5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil                         depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm,                         0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents                         the soil surface.The map unit average National Commodity Crop Productivity                         Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low productivity and high                         index values indicate high productivity) are provided for major earthy                         components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains, and                         cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also                         identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa                         components that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil                         components where the majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A                         map unit percent composition for earthy major components is provided. See                         Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and M. P. Robotham. 2012. National                         Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide, Version 2. USDA-NRCS.                         Available at:                         ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit                         average root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters                         for major earthy components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include:                         presence of hard bedrock, soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric                         material, a dense layer, a layer having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer                         having an electrical conductivity of more than 12 within the component soil                         profile. If no root-restricting zone is identified, a depth of 150 cm is                         used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et al., 2012). The map unit                         average available water storage within the root zone depth for major earthy                         components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil landscapes                         comprise those map units that have available water storage within the root                         zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)                         expressed as ""1"" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or ""0"" for                         a nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas                         (includes water bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version                         1) information is given as the percentage of the map unit (all components)                         that meet the criteria for a potential wetland soil landscape. See table                         column (field) description for criteria details. If water was determined to                         account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit, a value of 999 was used to                         indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution, but is helpful to                         identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit sum of the                         component percentage representative values is also provided as useful                         metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data                         are incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete                         data were handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO                         calculations for SOC and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following                         data checking and summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use                         the official data in the SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in                         case there were some data entry errors. However, there were a few exceptions                         to this principle if there was a good reason for a Null value in a critical                         variable, or to accommodate the data coding conventions used in some soil                         surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to the top of the surface                         horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were all okay, then                         the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to zero.If                         the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon                         represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was                         set to equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r =                         hzdept_r), effectively giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC                         or AWS), but not blocking calculation of other horizons in the profile due                         to horizon depth errors.Other types of horizon depth errors were considered                         uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths for the component being set to                         a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component from the analysis. The                         errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the soil profile,                         other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data for                         the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not                         indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values                         were effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the                         values at the map unit level could be an underestimate for some                         soils.Horizon rock fragment considerations:Part of the algorithm for                         calculating the SOC requires finding the volume of soil that is not rock.                         This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate rock fragments                         (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not organic, and                         any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to the                         total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as                         “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is                         organic, then it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was                         made, and default values for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these                         variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0, frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100).                         Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the horizon designator or the                         texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed Plant Material”. If                         all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated more than                         100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero for                         SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation                         because rock content is already accounted for in the available water                         capacity (awc_r) variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component                         summary:To summarize data from the horizon level to the component level, the                         evaluation proceeded downward from the surface. If a valid value for AWS                         could not be calculated for any horizon, then the result for that horizon                         and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was separately                         applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for SOC                         but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data                         from the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages                         must be valid. There are tests both of the individual component percentage                         (comppct_r) data, and also of the sum of the component percentages at the                         map unit level (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following                         rules were applied for the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be                         in the range from 0 to 100, inclusive. 2) Individual components with a                         comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded) were ignored. A zero comppct_r value                         excludes the component from having an effect on the map unit calculation. No                         values more than 100% were found in the data for individual comppct_r.Two                         additional rules were applied for the sum of the component percentages in a                         map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r must be in                         the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was set                         to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With                         these rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or                         SOC compared to what would have been calculated if there were complete data                         and/or no comppct_r errors.Metadata variables: sums of component                         percentages:Several metadata variables are provided in the VALU table to                         help understand when the AWS and SOC values are underestimated because of                         these component percentage issues. The sum of the component percentages for                         the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this is greater than                         100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results will be                         given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the                         soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS                         and SOC values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be                         an underestimate if the unreported soils would have had values for these                         measures.The sums of the component percentages that were used in the AWS and                         SOC calculations are also reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and                         mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values are less than the                         mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient data to                         compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables                         essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of                         an AWS or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as                         bedrock at the surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these                         rules and their implications, including explicit examples, will be given in                         a forthcoming publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA                         NRCS, Lincoln, NE.

This dataset is called the Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database and is                         derived from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is                         generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the                         National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping                         standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived                         from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information                         System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO                         digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents, and adding a                         State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added                         look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The recently released (2011)                         gSSURGO value added look up (valu) table (created by USDA-NRCS) contains                         attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice                         generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The                         generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and                         percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.Summarized description of                         the Format and organization of SSURGO:Adjacent soil surveys may have been                         composed by different individuals, and may be of widely different vintages.

This dataset is called the Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database and is                         derived from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is                         generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the                         National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping                         standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived                         from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information                         System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO                         digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents, and adding a                         State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added                         look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The recently released (2011)                         gSSURGO value added look up (valu) table (created by USDA-NRCS) contains                         attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice                         generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users.

The gridded map                         layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster and                         vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10                         meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal                         Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier                         called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster                         cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look                         up (valu) table that contains additional derived data. The value added look                         up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level                         using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of                         most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted                         averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.

The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected                         geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The                         geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical                         equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available                         governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a                         seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each                         county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent                         data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2005                         First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing                         physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files                         contain information distributed over a series of record types for the                         spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic                         data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be                         used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information                         contained in the files includes attributes such as feature                         identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature                         types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical                         entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,                         landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.

The Board's composition and                         purpose were created in 1936 by Amendment 23 to the Arkansas Constitution.                         The Board is responsible for redrawing 100 House and 35 Senate Districts so                         that each district meets various legal criteria, including each district                         being about the same size in population. This redistricting is required by                         law once every 10 years after the Federal Census. The District boundaries                         represent the legal boundary of each district. The boundaries were extracted                         from census block, voting district (VTD) or county boundaries in the 2010                         Census files.

The Arkansas Secretary of State contracted the University of Arkansas                         at Little Rock, GIS Applications Laboratory (UALRGIS) to use modern                         geographic information technology and improved base maps to create a current                         and spatially accurate statewide depiction of school district boundaries in                         the State of Arkansas. The Arkansas Geographic Information Office merged                         annexed and consolidated districts. UALRGIS followed a work plan for the                         project that was established by the Arkansas Geographic Information Office                         (AGIO) for the Secretary of State. The school district boundary editing                         rules were as follows: 1. Legal descriptions take precedent. 2. If no legal                         description was provided the visual evidence presented on the digital ortho                         quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) was followed. 3. Section lines, county boundaries,                         city boundaries and / or roads have only be used as supporting visual                         evidence viewed on the DOQQ. In the case of consolidation or annexation,                         state code 6-13-1415 and 6-13-1416 states: (1) A consolidation or annexation                         order adopted by the state board shall be filed with the: (A) County Clerk                         of each county that contains school district territory of each affected                         district, receiving district, or resulting district; (B) Secretary of State;                         and (C) Arkansas Geographic Information Office. (2) A consolidation or                         annexation order shall include a map of the boundaries of the resulting                         district or receiving district. (3) A consolidation or annexation order file                         with the Secretary of State and the Arkansas Geographic Information Office                         shall include a digital map showing the boundaries of the resulting district                         or receiving district in a format prescribed by the Arkansas Geographic                         Information Office.

911 Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) service area boundaries in                         Arkansas According to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), a                         Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is a facility equipped and staffed to                         receive 9-1-1 calls. The service area is the geographic area within which a                         911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This                         dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and                         wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive                         calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been                         transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where                         another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency                         telephone systems. To connect to such system from within a military base it                         may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive                         nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these                         systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered                         information about these systems or if adding a military PSAP was necessary                         to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset.                         Otherwise military installations are depicted as being covered by one or                         more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases areas are                         covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the                         applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may                         depend on how busy the applicable PSAPS are (i.e. load balancing),                         operational status (i.e. redundancy), or time of date / day of week. If an                         area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along                         with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas                         where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services.                         These records can be identified by a ""Y"" in the [NON911EMNO] field. This                         indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one                         with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering                         information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases this was                         geospatial information, in others it was tabular. This information was                         supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission                         (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases                         where the source data was not geospatial, each PSAP was researched to                         determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g. city and                         county boundaries). In some cases existing boundaries had to be modified to                         reflect coverage areas (e.g. “entire county north of Country Road 30”).                         However, there may be cases where minor deviations from existing boundaries                         are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a particular PSAPs                         coverage area includes an entire county, and the homes and businesses along                         a road which is partly in another county. Text fields in this dataset have                         been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search                         results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have                         been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate                         use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

This dataset contains polygons which represent justice of the peace                         boundaries for the State of Arkansas. By Arkansas law, the political                         subdivisions of the State are required to review the boundary lines of                         various election districts after each decennial census. This ensures the                         citizens of the county are equally represented by their elected officials.                         This process is widely known as redistricting. The process of establishing                         new districts or updating boundary lines is subject to certain                         constitutional and statutory requirements. The number of Quorum Court                         districts per county in Arkansas is based upon population ranges (Arkansas                         Code 14-14-402).

The Board of Apportionment, members were Governor Mike Beebe,                         Secretary of State Mark Martin and Attorney General Dustin McDaniel. The                         Board's composition and purpose were created in 1936 by Amendment 23 to the                         Arkansas Constitution. The Board is responsible for redrawing 100 House and                         35 Senate Districts so that each district meets various legal criteria,                         including each district being about the same size in population. This                         redistricting is required by law once every 10 years after the Federal                         Census. The District boundaries represent the legal boundary of each                         district. The boundaries were extracted from census block, voting district                         (VTD) or county boundaries in the 2010 Census files. A public record of the                         boundary plan is on file at the Elections Division of the Arkansas Secretary                         of State Office.

STATEMENT OF CASE                         The Staff of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (“Applicant”) filed an                         application requesting an immediate moratorium on any new or additional                         Class II Commercial Disposal Well or Class II Disposal Well permits in any                         of the Sections identified in Exhibit 1A or 1B of the Application, that is                         to remain in effect until the Commission adopts a General Rule establishing                         a permanent moratorium area FINDINGS OF FACT From the evidence introduced at                         said hearing, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (hereinafter referred to                         as AOGC) finds: 1. That the Director filed an application requesting an                         immediate moratorium on any new or additional Class II Commercial Disposal                         Well or Class II Disposal Well permits in any of the Sections identified in                         Exhibit 1A or 1B of the application (“moratorium area”), that is to remain                         in effect until the Commission adopts a General Rule establishing a                         permanent area. 2. That seismic activity has been enhanced, induced, or                         triggered in other areas of the country in the past. 3. That seismic                         activity occurring within the moratorium area has revealed a previously                         unknown or unmapped fault system. 4. That the particular fault highlighted                         by the seismic activity may be capable of producing additional earthquakes                         of similar or greater magnitude as have already occurred. 5. That this fault                         system, highlighted by the recent activity associated with the                         Guy-Greenbrier Earthquake Swarm, indicates a general northeast-southwest                         (approximately N30ºE) trending fault system which displaces the Lower                         Ordovician through Precambrian strata. 6. That, at the time of the hearing,                         there were four Disposal wells within the moratorium area. However, the                         permit holder of both the SRE 8-12 1-17 Class II Disposal Well (Permit No.                         43266) and the Trammel Class II Disposal well (Permit No. 41079), and the                         permit holder of the Wayne L. Edgmon No. 1 Class II Commercial Disposal well                         (Permit No. 36380), agreed to immediately and permanently cease all disposal                         operations in both disposal wells, and to properly plug the subject disposal                         wells by ORDER NO. 180A-2-2011-07 August 02, 2011 September 30, 2011. The                         remaining Class II Commercial Disposal Well, the Moore, W E Estate No. 1                         Class II Commercial Disposal well (Permit No. 39487), is subject to the                         provisions of Order No. 180A-1-2011-07. 7.

Data available online through GeoStor at                         http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The subject file represents Civil Divisions                         2000 for the State of Arkansas. It is a registered trademark of the Bureau                         of the Census and an extract of selected geographic and cartographic                         information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage for a                         single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, based                         on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of files includes all                         counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States and                         Puerto Rico. Files for the Island Areas are not included. The Census TIGER                         database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps                         between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to                         stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover                         the whole Nation. The files consist of line segments representing physical                         features and governmental and statistical boundaries. They do NOT contain                         the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of                         approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line                         files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing these files in advance of the                         computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the                         TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for                         tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a                         series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17                         record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points,                         and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare                         maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes                         attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC)                         used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes codes for                         legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and                         point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic                         features, and area boundaries.

The Arkansas Historic District dataset contains the boundaries for all                         historic districts in Arkansas. The districts are formally designated                         through a process administered by the Arkansas Historic Preservation                         Program. These areas typically contain a concentration of buildings where                         half the structures are at least 50 years old and represent important                         elements of the areas. Property owners within the District may become                         eligible for federal tax credits through rehabilitation projects.The                         designation follows the process outlined below:The mayor or other                         representative of the interested city contacts the AHPP to express interest                         in the project.AHPP historians will visit the city to evaluate whether or                         not a sufficient concentration of historic structures exists to be                         designated a historic district.

Most questions                         and concerns about the project can be addressed at the meeting.After the                         meeting, the local partners will poll the property owners to determine                         whether or not at least 51 percent of them are interested in the historic                         district designation.After being notified that a majority of the owners are                         interested, the AHPP will contract an architectural resources survey of the                         district area, in which each building will be photographed and informational                         forms completed.At the completion of the survey, the AHPP will contract to                         have a National Register nomination completed for the district.When the                         nomination is completed, the AHPP will present it to its State Review Board,                         which meets the first Wednesday in April, August and December to make formal                         nominations to the National Register.Following the meeting, the nominations                         are sent to the Keeper of the National Register in Washington, D.C., who                         makes the final decision on whether a property is listed (The AHPP has a 99                         percent success rate in this process).The decision on listing will be made                         within six weeks of delivery of the nomination to the Keeper.
