        <description>The Arkansas Historic District dataset contains the boundaries for all historic
                districts in Arkansas. The districts are formally designated through a process
                administered by the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program. These areas typically
                contain a concentration of buildings where half the structures are at least 50 years
                old and represent important elements of the areas. Property owners within the
                District may become eligible for federal tax credits through rehabilitation
                projects.The designation follows the process outlined below:The mayor or other
                representative of the interested city contacts the AHPP to express interest in the
                project.AHPP historians will visit the city to evaluate whether or not a sufficient
                concentration of historic structures exists to be designated a historic district.
                (Basically, at least 51 percent of the buildings must be 50 years or older and still
                reflect their historic appearance.)If a potential district exists, the AHPP will
                contact the city and provide a list of addresses for the buildings in the area that
                is eligible for district designation. The city or other local partners will generate
                the list of property owners.The AHPP will then work with the city to set a time and
                place for an informational meeting with property owners; the AHPP will mail letters
                to each of the property owners informing them of the meeting.At the meeting, AHPP
                representatives will explain the project, what is does and does not mean to be
                listed on the National Register, and how the 20 percent federal rehabilitation tax
                project works. Most questions and concerns about the project can be addressed at the
                meeting.After the meeting, the local partners will poll the property owners to
                determine whether or not at least 51 percent of them are interested in the historic
                district designation.After being notified that a majority of the owners are
                interested, the AHPP will contract an architectural resources survey of the district
                area, in which each building will be photographed and informational forms
                completed.At the completion of the survey, the AHPP will contract to have a National
                Register nomination completed for the district.When the nomination is completed, the
                AHPP will present it to its State Review Board, which meets the first Wednesday in
                April, August and December to make formal nominations to the National
                Register.Following the meeting, the nominations are sent to the Keeper of the
                National Register in Washington, D.C., who makes the final decision on whether a
                property is listed (The AHPP has a 99 percent success rate in this process).The
                decision on listing will be made within six weeks of delivery of the nomination to
                the Keeper.</description>

        <description>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The
                subject file represents Civil Divisions 2000 for the State of Arkansas. It is a
                registered trademark of the Bureau of the Census and an extract of selected
                geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The
                geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical
                equivalent entity, based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of
                files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United
                States and Puerto Rico. Files for the Island Areas are not included. The Census
                TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between
                parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an
                independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The
                files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and
                statistical boundaries. They do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
                and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in
                the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing these files in
                advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the
                TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating
                Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types
                for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic
                data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with
                appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the
                files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes
                (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes codes for
                legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point
                features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area
                boundaries.</description>

                CLASS II DISPOSAL WELL PERMITS IN CERTAIN AREAS. After due notice and public hearing
                in El Dorado, Arkansas, on July 26, 2011, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, in
                order to prevent waste, carry out an orderly program of development, protect the
                correlative rights of each owner in the common source(s) of supply, prevent the
                pollution of fresh water supplies and unnecessary damage to property, soil, animals,
                or aquatic life by oil, gas or salt water, and to protect the health and welfare of
                the public, has found the following facts and issued the following Order. STATEMENT
                OF CASE The Staff of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (“Applicant”) filed an
                application requesting an immediate moratorium on any new or additional Class II
                Commercial Disposal Well or Class II Disposal Well permits in any of the Sections
                identified in Exhibit 1A or 1B of the Application, that is to remain in effect until
                the Commission adopts a General Rule establishing a permanent moratorium area
                FINDINGS OF FACT From the evidence introduced at said hearing, the Arkansas Oil and
                Gas Commission (hereinafter referred to as AOGC) finds: 1. That the Director filed
                an application requesting an immediate moratorium on any new or additional Class II
                Commercial Disposal Well or Class II Disposal Well permits in any of the Sections
                identified in Exhibit 1A or 1B of the application (“moratorium area”), that is to
                remain in effect until the Commission adopts a General Rule establishing a permanent
                area. 2. That seismic activity has been enhanced, induced, or triggered in other
                areas of the country in the past. 3. That seismic activity occurring within the
                moratorium area has revealed a previously unknown or unmapped fault system. 4. That
                the particular fault highlighted by the seismic activity may be capable of producing
                additional earthquakes of similar or greater magnitude as have already occurred. 5.
                That this fault system, highlighted by the recent activity associated with the
                Guy-Greenbrier Earthquake Swarm, indicates a general northeast-southwest
                (approximately N30ºE) trending fault system which displaces the Lower Ordovician
                through Precambrian strata. 6. That, at the time of the hearing, there were four
                Disposal wells within the moratorium area. However, the permit holder of both the
                SRE 8-12 1-17 Class II Disposal Well (Permit No. 43266) and the Trammel Class II
                Disposal well (Permit No. 41079), and the permit holder of the Wayne L. Edgmon No. 1
                Class II Commercial Disposal well (Permit No. 36380), agreed to immediately and
                permanently cease all disposal operations in both disposal wells, and to properly
                plug the subject disposal wells by ORDER NO. 180A-2-2011-07 August 02, 2011
                September 30, 2011. The remaining Class II Commercial Disposal Well, the Moore, W E
                Estate No. 1 Class II Commercial Disposal well (Permit No. 39487), is subject to the
                provisions of Order No. 180A-1-2011-07. 7. That no objects were filed in relation to
                Docket No. 180A-1-2011-07. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. That due notice of public hearing
                was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over said
                parties and the matter herein considered. 2. That this Commission has authority to
                grant or deny said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as
                amended. ORDER It is, therefore, ordered by the Commission: that an immediate
                moratorium is in effect for any new or additional Class II Commercial Disposal Well
                or Class II Disposal Wells within the moratorium area described in the application,
                more specifically, as described or depicted in Exhibits 1A and 1B of Docket No.
                180A-2011-07, that shall remain in effect until the Commission adopts a General Rule
                establishing a permanent moratorium area. This Order shall be effective from and
                after August 02, 2011; and the Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction for the
                purposes of enforcement, and/or modifications or amendments to the provisions of
                this Order. ARKANSAS OIL AND GAS COMMISSION Lawrence E. Bengal,

        <description>This dataset contains polygons and attributes which represent the voting
                precincts for the counties in the State of Arkansas. It includes the precinct name
                or number assigned by each County Election Commission following the redistricting
                process. The data was generated following the release of the 2010 Census data and
                was finalized in 2012. During the redistricting process a number of administrative
                boundaries were redrawn. The voting precincts include mulitpart polygons that are
                not contiguous in some counties. The compilation of this data is an effort of the
                Secretary of State to aid in election administration and future redistricting. </description>

                boundaries adopted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment on July 29, 2011. The
                Board of Apportionment, members were Governor Mike Beebe, Secretary of State Mark
                Martin and Attorney General Dustin McDaniel. The Board's composition and purpose
                were created in 1936 by Amendment 23 to the Arkansas Constitution. The Board is
                responsible for redrawing 100 House and 35 Senate Districts so that each district
                meets various legal criteria, including each district being about the same size in
                population. This redistricting is required by law once every 10 years after the
                Federal Census. The District boundaries represent the legal boundary of each
                district. The boundaries were extracted from census block, voting district (VTD) or
                county boundaries in the 2010 Census files. A public record of the boundary plan is
                on file at the Elections Division of the Arkansas Secretary of State Office. </description>

        <description>This dataset contains polygons which represent justice of the peace boundaries
                for the State of Arkansas. By Arkansas law, the political subdivisions of the State
                are required to review the boundary lines of various election districts after each
                decennial census. This ensures the citizens of the county are equally represented by
                their elected officials. This process is widely known as redistricting. The process
                of establishing new districts or updating boundary lines is subject to certain
                constitutional and statutory requirements. The number of Quorum Court districts per
                county in Arkansas is based upon population ranges (Arkansas Code 14-14-402). The
                number of Quorum Court districts per county in Arkansas is based upon population

        <description> 911 Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) service area boundaries in Arkansas
                According to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), a Public Safety
                Answering Point (PSAP) is a facility equipped and staffed to receive 9-1-1 calls.
                The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a
                landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary
                PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from
                this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive
                calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in
                cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency
                telephone systems. To connect to such system from within a military base it may be
                necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military
                installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities
                in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems or if adding a
                military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included
                it in this dataset. Otherwise military installations are depicted as being covered
                by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases areas
                are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable
                PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy
                the applicable PSAPS are (i.e. load balancing), operational status (i.e.
                redundancy), or time of date / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service,
                TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of
                their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit
                number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a "Y" in the
                [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does
                not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering
                information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases this was
                geospatial information, in others it was tabular. This information was supplemented
                with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was
                researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not
                geospatial, each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of
                existing boundaries (e.g. city and county boundaries). In some cases existing
                boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g. “entire county north
                of Country Road 30”). However, there may be cases where minor deviations from
                existing boundaries are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a
                particular PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county, and the homes and
                businesses along a road which is partly in another county. Text fields in this
                dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine
                search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have
                been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with
                database systems that may not support diacritics. </description>

        <description>The Arkansas Secretary of State contracted the University of Arkansas at Little
                Rock, GIS Applications Laboratory (UALRGIS) to use modern geographic information
                technology and improved base maps to create a current and spatially accurate
                statewide depiction of school district boundaries in the State of Arkansas. The
                Arkansas Geographic Information Office merged annexed and consolidated districts.
                UALRGIS followed a work plan for the project that was established by the Arkansas
                Geographic Information Office (AGIO) for the Secretary of State. The school district
                boundary editing rules were as follows: 1. Legal descriptions take precedent. 2. If
                no legal description was provided the visual evidence presented on the digital ortho
                quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) was followed. 3. Section lines, county boundaries, city
                boundaries and / or roads have only be used as supporting visual evidence viewed on
                the DOQQ. In the case of consolidation or annexation, state code 6-13-1415 and
                6-13-1416 states: (1) A consolidation or annexation order adopted by the state board
                shall be filed with the: (A) County Clerk of each county that contains school
                district territory of each affected district, receiving district, or resulting
                district; (B) Secretary of State; and (C) Arkansas Geographic Information Office.
                (2) A consolidation or annexation order shall include a map of the boundaries of the
                resulting district or receiving district. (3) A consolidation or annexation order
                file with the Secretary of State and the Arkansas Geographic Information Office
                shall include a digital map showing the boundaries of the resulting district or
                receiving district in a format prescribed by the Arkansas Geographic Information
                Office.</description>

        <description>This layer represents the Arkansas State Senate district boundaries adopted by
                the Arkansas Board of Apportionment on July 29, 2011. The Board of Apportionment,
                members were Governor Mike Beebe, Secretary of State Mark Martin and Attorney
                General Dustin McDaniel. The Board's composition and purpose were created in 1936 by
                Amendment 23 to the Arkansas Constitution. The Board is responsible for redrawing
                100 House and 35 Senate Districts so that each district meets various legal
                criteria, including each district being about the same size in population. This
                redistricting is required by law once every 10 years after the Federal Census. The
                District boundaries represent the legal boundary of each district. The boundaries
                were extracted from census block, voting district (VTD) or county boundaries in the
                2010 Census files. A public record of the boundary plan is on file at the Elections
                Division of the Arkansas Secretary of State Office.</description>

        <description> The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic
                and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage
                for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the
                coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census
                TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between
                parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an
                independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The
                2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical
                features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information
                distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There
                are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points,
                and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.
                Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as
                feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature
                types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,
                latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point
                features, area landmarks, and area boundaries. </description>

                detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil
                Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards. The tabular data represent
                the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in
                the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by
                merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide
                extents, and adding a State-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a
                new value added look up (valu) table containing "ready to map" attributes. The
                gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. The raster
                and vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10 meter
                cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal Area projection.
                Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key.
                A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute
                tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional
                derived data. The value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data
                summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended
                to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit
                component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given

                soil surveys may have been composed by different individuals, and may be of widely
                different vintages. Any given survey must comply with basic standards, but older
                surveys reflect a more generalized approach than more modern surveys. The figure to

                the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by
                merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide

        <description>This dataset contains the common Map Unit attributes for each polygon within
                the gSSURGO database plus NRCS derived attributes from a data summary table called
                the National Valu Added Look Up (valu) Table #1. It is comprised of 57
                pre-summarized or "ready to map" derived soil survey geographic database attributes
                including soil organic carbon, available water storage, crop productivity indices,
                crop root zone depths, available water storage within crop root zone depths, drought
                vulnerable soil landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. Related metadata
                values for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map
                unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of
                most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages
                and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria. These themes were prepared to
                better meet the mapping needs of users of soil survey information and can be used
                with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO)
                Database is derived from the official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database.
                SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
                National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.
                The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and
                characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO
                data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data
                into State-wide extents, and adding a State-wide gridded map layer derived from the
                vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing "ready to map"
                attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster
                format. The raster and vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data
                have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal
                Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called
                the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons
                to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that
                contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The map unit average Soil
                Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C per square meter for eleven
                standard layer or zone depths. The average thickness of soil map unit component
                horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers
                include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum
                reported soil depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer),
                o-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents
                the soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are given
                in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average
                thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations
                is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm,
                100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth). The standard zones include:
                0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported
                soil depth). Zero cm represents the soil surface.The map unit average National
                Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low
                productivity and high index values indicate high productivity) are provided for
                major earthy components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains,
                and cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also
                identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa components
                that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil components where the
                majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A map unit percent composition
                for earthy major components is provided. See Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and
                M. P. Robotham. 2012. National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide,

                ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit average
                root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters for major earthy
                components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include: presence of hard bedrock,
                soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric material, a dense layer, a layer
                having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer having an electrical conductivity of more
                than 12 within the component soil profile. If no root-restricting zone is
                identified, a depth of 150 cm is used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et
                al., 2012). The map unit average available water storage within the root zone depth
                for major earthy components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil
                landscapes comprise those map units that have available water storage within the
                root zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)
                expressed as "1" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or "0" for a
                nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas (includes water
                bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version 1) information is given
                as the percentage of the map unit (all components) that meet the criteria for a
                potential wetland soil landscape. See table column (field) description for criteria
                details. If water was determined to account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit,
                a value of 999 was used to indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution,
                but is helpful to identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit
                sum of the component percentage representative values is also provided as useful
                metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data are
                incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete data were
                handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO calculations for SOC
                and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following data checking and
                summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use the official data in the
                SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in case there were some data entry
                errors. However, there were a few exceptions to this principle if there was a good
                reason for a Null value in a critical variable, or to accommodate the data coding
                conventions used in some soil surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to
                the top of the surface horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were
                all okay, then the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to
                zero.If the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon
                represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was set to
                equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r = hzdept_r), effectively
                giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC or AWS), but not blocking
                calculation of other horizons in the profile due to horizon depth errors.Other types
                of horizon depth errors were considered uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths
                for the component being set to a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component
                from the analysis. The errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the
                soil profile, other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data
                for the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not
                indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values were
                effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the values at the
                map unit level could be an underestimate for some soils.Horizon rock fragment
                considerations:Part of the algorithm for calculating the SOC requires finding the
                volume of soil that is not rock. This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate
                rock fragments (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not
                organic, and any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to
                the total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as
                “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is organic, then
                it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was made, and default values
                for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0,
                frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100). Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the
                horizon designator or the texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed
                Plant Material”. If all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated
                more than 100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero
                for SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation because
                rock content is already accounted for in the available water capacity (awc_r)
                variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component summary:To summarize data from
                the horizon level to the component level, the evaluation proceeded downward from the
                surface. If a valid value for AWS could not be calculated for any horizon, then the
                result for that horizon and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was
                separately applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for
                SOC but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data from
                the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages must be valid.
                There are tests both of the individual component percentage (comppct_r) data, and
                also of the sum of the component percentages at the map unit level
                (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following rules were applied for
                the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be in the range from 0 to 100,
                inclusive. 2) Individual components with a comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded)
                were ignored. A zero comppct_r value excludes the component from having an effect on
                the map unit calculation. No values more than 100% were found in the data for
                individual comppct_r.Two additional rules were applied for the sum of the component
                percentages in a map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r
                must be in the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was
                set to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With these
                rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or SOC compared to
                what would have been calculated if there were complete data and/or no comppct_r
                errors.Metadata variables: sums of component percentages:Several metadata variables
                are provided in the VALU table to help understand when the AWS and SOC values are
                underestimated because of these component percentage issues. The sum of the
                component percentages for the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this
                is greater than 100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results
                will be given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the
                soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS and SOC
                values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be an underestimate
                if the unreported soils would have had values for these measures.The sums of the
                component percentages that were used in the AWS and SOC calculations are also
                reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values
                are less than the mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient
                data to compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables
                essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of an AWS
                or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as bedrock at the
                surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these rules and their
                implications, including explicit examples, will be given in a forthcoming
                publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA NRCS, Lincoln,
                NE.</description>

        <description>This dataset contains the common Map Unit attributes for each polygon within
                the gSSURGO database plus NRCS derived attributes from a data summary table called
                the National Valu Added Look Up (valu) Table #1. It is comprised of 57
                pre-summarized or "ready to map" derived soil survey geographic database attributes
                including soil organic carbon, available water storage, crop productivity indices,
                crop root zone depths, available water storage within crop root zone depths, drought
                vulnerable soil landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. Related metadata
                values for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map
                unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of
                most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages
                and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria. These themes were prepared to
                better meet the mapping needs of users of soil survey information and can be used
                with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO)
                Database is derived from the official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database.
                SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
                National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.
                The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and
                characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO
                data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data
                into State-wide extents, and adding a State-wide gridded map layer derived from the
                vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing "ready to map"
                attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster
                format. The raster and vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data
                have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal
                Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called
                the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons
                to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that
                contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The map unit average Soil
                Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C per square meter for eleven
                standard layer or zone depths. The average thickness of soil map unit component
                horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers
                include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum
                reported soil depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer),
                o-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents
                the soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are given
                in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average
                thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations
                is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm,
                100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth). The standard zones include:
                0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported
                soil depth). Zero cm represents the soil surface.The map unit average National
                Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low
                productivity and high index values indicate high productivity) are provided for
                major earthy components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains,
                and cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also
                identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa components
                that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil components where the
                majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A map unit percent composition
                for earthy major components is provided. See Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and
                M. P. Robotham. 2012. National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide,

                ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit average
                root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters for major earthy
                components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include: presence of hard bedrock,
                soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric material, a dense layer, a layer
                having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer having an electrical conductivity of more
                than 12 within the component soil profile. If no root-restricting zone is
                identified, a depth of 150 cm is used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et
                al., 2012). The map unit average available water storage within the root zone depth
                for major earthy components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil
                landscapes comprise those map units that have available water storage within the
                root zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)
                expressed as "1" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or "0" for a
                nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas (includes water
                bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version 1) information is given
                as the percentage of the map unit (all components) that meet the criteria for a
                potential wetland soil landscape. See table column (field) description for criteria
                details. If water was determined to account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit,
                a value of 999 was used to indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution,
                but is helpful to identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit
                sum of the component percentage representative values is also provided as useful
                metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data are
                incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete data were
                handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO calculations for SOC
                and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following data checking and
                summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use the official data in the
                SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in case there were some data entry
                errors. However, there were a few exceptions to this principle if there was a good
                reason for a Null value in a critical variable, or to accommodate the data coding
                conventions used in some soil surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to
                the top of the surface horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were
                all okay, then the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to
                zero.If the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon
                represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was set to
                equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r = hzdept_r), effectively
                giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC or AWS), but not blocking
                calculation of other horizons in the profile due to horizon depth errors.Other types
                of horizon depth errors were considered uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths
                for the component being set to a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component
                from the analysis. The errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the
                soil profile, other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data
                for the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not
                indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values were
                effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the values at the
                map unit level could be an underestimate for some soils.Horizon rock fragment
                considerations:Part of the algorithm for calculating the SOC requires finding the
                volume of soil that is not rock. This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate
                rock fragments (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not
                organic, and any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to
                the total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as
                “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is organic, then
                it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was made, and default values
                for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0,
                frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100). Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the
                horizon designator or the texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed
                Plant Material”. If all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated
                more than 100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero
                for SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation because
                rock content is already accounted for in the available water capacity (awc_r)
                variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component summary:To summarize data from
                the horizon level to the component level, the evaluation proceeded downward from the
                surface. If a valid value for AWS could not be calculated for any horizon, then the
                result for that horizon and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was
                separately applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for
                SOC but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data from
                the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages must be valid.
                There are tests both of the individual component percentage (comppct_r) data, and
                also of the sum of the component percentages at the map unit level
                (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following rules were applied for
                the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be in the range from 0 to 100,
                inclusive. 2) Individual components with a comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded)
                were ignored. A zero comppct_r value excludes the component from having an effect on
                the map unit calculation. No values more than 100% were found in the data for
                individual comppct_r.Two additional rules were applied for the sum of the component
                percentages in a map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r
                must be in the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was
                set to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With these
                rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or SOC compared to
                what would have been calculated if there were complete data and/or no comppct_r
                errors.Metadata variables: sums of component percentages:Several metadata variables
                are provided in the VALU table to help understand when the AWS and SOC values are
                underestimated because of these component percentage issues. The sum of the
                component percentages for the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this
                is greater than 100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results
                will be given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the
                soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS and SOC
                values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be an underestimate
                if the unreported soils would have had values for these measures.The sums of the
                component percentages that were used in the AWS and SOC calculations are also
                reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values
                are less than the mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient
                data to compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables
                essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of an AWS
                or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as bedrock at the
                surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these rules and their
                implications, including explicit examples, will be given in a forthcoming
                publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA NRCS, Lincoln,

        <description>This dataset contains the common Map Unit attributes for each polygon within
                the gSSURGO database plus NRCS derived attributes from a data summary table called
                the National Valu Added Look Up (valu) Table #1. It is comprised of 57
                pre-summarized or "ready to map" derived soil survey geographic database attributes
                including soil organic carbon, available water storage, crop productivity indices,
                crop root zone depths, available water storage within crop root zone depths, drought
                vulnerable soil landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. Related metadata
                values for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map
                unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of
                most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages
                and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria. These themes were prepared to
                better meet the mapping needs of users of soil survey information and can be used
                with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO)
                Database is derived from the official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database.
                SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
                National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.
                The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and
                characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO
                data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data
                into State-wide extents, and adding a State-wide gridded map layer derived from the
                vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing "ready to map"
                attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster
                format. The raster and vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data
                have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal
                Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called
                the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons
                to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that
                contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The map unit average Soil
                Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C per square meter for eleven
                standard layer or zone depths. The average thickness of soil map unit component
                horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers
                include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum
                reported soil depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer),
                o-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents
                the soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are given
                in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average
                thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations
                is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm,
                100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth). The standard zones include:
                0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported
                soil depth). Zero cm represents the soil surface.The map unit average National
                Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low
                productivity and high index values indicate high productivity) are provided for
                major earthy components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains,
                and cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also
                identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa components
                that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil components where the
                majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A map unit percent composition
                for earthy major components is provided. See Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and
                M. P. Robotham. 2012. National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide,
                Version 2. USDA-NRCS. Available at:
                ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit average
                root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters for major earthy
                components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include: presence of hard bedrock,
                soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric material, a dense layer, a layer
                having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer having an electrical conductivity of more
                than 12 within the component soil profile. If no root-restricting zone is
                identified, a depth of 150 cm is used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et
                al., 2012). The map unit average available water storage within the root zone depth
                for major earthy components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil
                landscapes comprise those map units that have available water storage within the
                root zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)
                expressed as "1" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or "0" for a
                nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas (includes water
                bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version 1) information is given
                as the percentage of the map unit (all components) that meet the criteria for a
                potential wetland soil landscape. See table column (field) description for criteria
                details. If water was determined to account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit,
                a value of 999 was used to indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution,
                but is helpful to identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit
                sum of the component percentage representative values is also provided as useful
                metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data are
                incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete data were
                handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO calculations for SOC
                and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following data checking and
                summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use the official data in the
                SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in case there were some data entry
                errors. However, there were a few exceptions to this principle if there was a good
                reason for a Null value in a critical variable, or to accommodate the data coding
                conventions used in some soil surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to
                the top of the surface horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were
                all okay, then the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to
                zero.If the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon
                represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was set to
                equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r = hzdept_r), effectively
                giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC or AWS), but not blocking
                calculation of other horizons in the profile due to horizon depth errors.Other types
                of horizon depth errors were considered uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths
                for the component being set to a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component
                from the analysis. The errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the
                soil profile, other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data
                for the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not
                indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values were
                effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the values at the
                map unit level could be an underestimate for some soils.Horizon rock fragment
                considerations:Part of the algorithm for calculating the SOC requires finding the
                volume of soil that is not rock. This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate
                rock fragments (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not
                organic, and any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to
                the total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as
                “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is organic, then
                it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was made, and default values
                for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0,
                frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100). Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the
                horizon designator or the texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed
                Plant Material”. If all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated
                more than 100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero
                for SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation because
                rock content is already accounted for in the available water capacity (awc_r)
                variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component summary:To summarize data from
                the horizon level to the component level, the evaluation proceeded downward from the
                surface. If a valid value for AWS could not be calculated for any horizon, then the
                result for that horizon and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was
                separately applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for
                SOC but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data from
                the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages must be valid.
                There are tests both of the individual component percentage (comppct_r) data, and
                also of the sum of the component percentages at the map unit level
                (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following rules were applied for
                the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be in the range from 0 to 100,
                inclusive. 2) Individual components with a comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded)
                were ignored. A zero comppct_r value excludes the component from having an effect on
                the map unit calculation. No values more than 100% were found in the data for
                individual comppct_r.Two additional rules were applied for the sum of the component
                percentages in a map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r
                must be in the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was
                set to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With these
                rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or SOC compared to
                what would have been calculated if there were complete data and/or no comppct_r
                errors.Metadata variables: sums of component percentages:Several metadata variables
                are provided in the VALU table to help understand when the AWS and SOC values are
                underestimated because of these component percentage issues. The sum of the
                component percentages for the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this
                is greater than 100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results
                will be given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the
                soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS and SOC
                values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be an underestimate
                if the unreported soils would have had values for these measures.The sums of the
                component percentages that were used in the AWS and SOC calculations are also
                reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values
                are less than the mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient
                data to compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables
                essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of an AWS
                or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as bedrock at the
                surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these rules and their
                implications, including explicit examples, will be given in a forthcoming
                publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA NRCS, Lincoln,

                values for themes are included. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map
                unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of
                most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages
                and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria. These themes were prepared to
                better meet the mapping needs of users of soil survey information and can be used
                with both SSURGO and Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) datasets. Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO)
                Database is derived from the official Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database.
                SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
                National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards.
                The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and
                characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO
                data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data
                into State-wide extents, and adding a State-wide gridded map layer derived from the
                vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing "ready to map"
                attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster
                format. The raster and vector map data have a State-wide extent. The raster map data
                have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal
                Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called
                the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons
                to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that
                contains additional derived data.VALU Table Content:The map unit average Soil
                Organic Carbon (SOC) values are given in units of g C per square meter for eleven
                standard layer or zone depths. The average thickness of soil map unit component
                horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations is also included. The standard layers
                include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm, 100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum
                reported soil depth). The standard zones include: 0-5cm (also a standard layer),
                o-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported soil depth). Zero cm represents
                the soil surface.The map unit average Available Water Storage (AWS) values are given
                in units of millimeters for eleven standard layer or zone depths. The average
                thickness of soil map unit component horizons used in these layer/zone calcuations
                is also included. The standard layers include: 0-5cm, 5-20cm, 20-50cm, 50-100cm,
                100-150cm, and 150-150+cm (maximum reported soil depth). The standard zones include:
                0-5cm (also a standard layer), 0-20cm, 0-30cm, 0-100cm, and 0-150+cm (full reported
                soil depth). Zero cm represents the soil surface.The map unit average National
                Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) values (low index values indicate low
                productivity and high index values indicate high productivity) are provided for
                major earthy components. NCCPI values are included for corn/soybeans, small grains,
                and cotton crops. Of these crops, the highest overall NCCPI value is also
                identified. Earthy components are those soil series or higher level taxa components
                that can support crop growth. Major components are those soil components where the
                majorcompflag = 'Yes' in the SSURGO component table. A map unit percent composition
                for earthy major components is provided. See Dobos, R. R., H. R. Sinclair, Jr, and
                M. P. Robotham. 2012. National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) User Guide,
                Version 2. USDA-NRCS. Available at:
                ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdfThe map unit average
                root zone depth values for commodity crops are given in centimeters for major earthy
                components. Criteria for root-limiting soil depth include: presence of hard bedrock,
                soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric material, a dense layer, a layer
                having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer having an electrical conductivity of more
                than 12 within the component soil profile. If no root-restricting zone is
                identified, a depth of 150 cm is used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et
                al., 2012). The map unit average available water storage within the root zone depth
                for major earthy components value is given in millimeters.Drought vulnerable soil
                landscapes comprise those map units that have available water storage within the
                root zone for commodity crops that is less than or equal to 6 inches (152 mm)
                expressed as "1" for a drought vulnerable soil landscape map unit or "0" for a
                nondroughty soil landscape map unit or NULL for miscellaneous areas (includes water
                bodies).The potential wetland soil landscapes (PWSL version 1) information is given
                as the percentage of the map unit (all components) that meet the criteria for a
                potential wetland soil landscape. See table column (field) description for criteria
                details. If water was determined to account for 80 or greater percent of a map unit,
                a value of 999 was used to indicate a water body. This is not a perfect solution,
                but is helpful to identifying a general water body class for mapping.The map unit
                sum of the component percentage representative values is also provided as useful
                metadata. For all valu table columns, NULL values are presented where data are
                incomplete or not available. How NoData or NULL values and incomplete data were
                handled during VALU table SOC and AWS calculations:The gSSURGO calculations for SOC
                and AWS as reported in the VALU table use the following data checking and
                summarization rules. The guiding principle was to only use the official data in the
                SSURGO database, and not to make assumptions in case there were some data entry
                errors. However, there were a few exceptions to this principle if there was a good
                reason for a Null value in a critical variable, or to accommodate the data coding
                conventions used in some soil surveys.Horizon depths considerations:If the depth to
                the top of the surface horizon was missing, but otherwise the horizon depths were
                all okay, then the depth to the top of the surface horizon (hzdept_r) was set to
                zero.If the depth to the bottom of the last horizon was missing, and the horizon
                represented bedrock or had missing bulk density, the depth to the bottom was set to
                equal to the depth to the top of the same horizon (hzdepb_r = hzdept_r), effectively
                giving the horizon zero thickness (and thus zero SOC or AWS), but not blocking
                calculation of other horizons in the profile due to horizon depth errors.Other types
                of horizon depth errors were considered uncorrectable, and led to all horizon depths
                for the component being set to a NoData value, effectively eliminating the component
                from the analysis. The errors included gaps or overlaps in the horizon depths of the
                soil profile, other cases of missing data for horizon depths, including missing data
                for the bottom depth of the last horizon if the soil texture information did not
                indicate bedrock and a bulk density value was coded. The SOC or AWS values were
                effectively set to zero for components eliminated in this way, so the values at the
                map unit level could be an underestimate for some soils.Horizon rock fragment
                considerations:Part of the algorithm for calculating the SOC requires finding the
                volume of soil that is not rock. This requires three SSURGO variables that indicate
                rock fragments (fraggt10_r, frag3to10_r, and sieveno10_r). If the soil is not
                organic, and any of these are missing, then the ratio of the volume of soil fines to
                the total soil volume was set to “NoData”, and the SOC results were coded as
                “NoData” and effectively set to zero for the horizon. If the soil is organic, then
                it may be logical that no measurement of rock fragments was made, and default values
                for the “zero rock” situation was assumed for these variables (i.e., fraggt10_r = 0,
                frag3to10_r = 0, sieveno10_r = 100). Organic soils were identified by an “O” in the
                horizon designator or the texture code represented “Peat”, “Muck” or “Decomposed
                Plant Material”. If all three of the fragment variables were present, but indicated
                more than 100% rock, then 100% rock was assumed (zero volume of soil and thus zero
                for SOC). The rock fragment variables do not influence the AWS calculation because
                rock content is already accounted for in the available water capacity (awc_r)
                variable at the horizon level.Horizon to component summary:To summarize data from
                the horizon level to the component level, the evaluation proceeded downward from the
                surface. If a valid value for AWS could not be calculated for any horizon, then the
                result for that horizon and all deeper horizons was set to NoData. The same rule was
                separately applied to the SOC calculation, so it was possible to have results for
                SOC but not AWS, or vice versa.Component to mapunit summary:To summarize data from
                the component level to the map unit level, the component percentages must be valid.
                There are tests both of the individual component percentage (comppct_r) data, and
                also of the sum of the component percentages at the map unit level
                (mu_sum_comppct_r). For the gSSURGO VALU table, the following rules were applied for
                the individual components: 1) The comppct_r must be in the range from 0 to 100,
                inclusive. 2) Individual components with a comppct_r that was Null (nothing coded)
                were ignored. A zero comppct_r value excludes the component from having an effect on
                the map unit calculation. No values more than 100% were found in the data for
                individual comppct_r.Two additional rules were applied for the sum of the component
                percentages in a map unit (ignoring NoData for comppct_r): 3) The mu_sum_comppct_r
                must be in the range from 1 to 100, inclusive, otherwise map unit level output was
                set to NoData, and 4) The mu_sum_comppct_r were not scaled to equal 100%. With these
                rules, the results may be an under-estimate of the value for AWS or SOC compared to
                what would have been calculated if there were complete data and/or no comppct_r
                errors.Metadata variables: sums of component percentages:Several metadata variables
                are provided in the VALU table to help understand when the AWS and SOC values are
                underestimated because of these component percentage issues. The sum of the
                component percentages for the map unit are reported in “mu_sum_comppct_r”. If this
                is greater than 100% or the comppct_r was NoData for all components, then no results
                will be given for the map unit. If the mu_sum_comppct_r is less than 100%, then the
                soil scientists likely did not report on all soils in the map unit. The AWS and SOC
                values will only reflect the reported soils, and therefore would be an underestimate
                if the unreported soils would have had values for these measures.The sums of the
                component percentages that were used in the AWS and SOC calculations are also
                reported (mu_sum_comppct_aws and mu_sum_comppct_soc, respectively). If these values
                are less than the mu_sum_comppct_r, it is an indication that there was insufficient
                data to compute the AWS and/or SOC values for all of the components. These variables
                essentially represent metadata for each map unit. In some cases, the lack of an AWS
                or SOC value may be appropriate (for example, for non-soils such as bedrock at the
                surface, gravel pits, or water).A full discussion of these rules and their
                implications, including explicit examples, will be given in a forthcoming
                publication as Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 53, USDA NRCS, Lincoln,
                NE.</description>

        <description>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. This
                data set is a digital general soil association map developed by the National
                Cooperative Soil Survey. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil
                areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be
                cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled
                by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps
                are not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are
                assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of
                like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are
                determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or
                sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to
                characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map
                data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree
                topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The
                soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record
                relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and
                their properties.</description>

        <description>This dataset contains point features representing the approximate location of
                tax parcels contained in County Assessor tax rolls. Individual county data was
                integrated into this statewide publication by the Arkansas Geographic Information
                Office (AGIO). The Computer Aided Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems maintained in each
                county are used to populate the database attributes for each centroid feature. The
                entity attribute structure conforms to the Arkansas Cadastral Mapping Standard. The
                digital cadastral data is provided as a publication version that only represents a
                snapshot of the production data at the time it was received from the county.
                Published updates may be made to counties throughout the year. These will occur
                after new data is digitized or updates to existing data are finished. Production
                versions of the data exist in the various counties where daily and weekly updates
                occur. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to determine the age of
                the data for a given county. This column reflects the date when AGIO received the
                data from the county. Only parcels with an associated Computer Assisted Mass
                Appraisal (CAMA) record are provided. This means a CAMA record may exist, but no
                point geometry or vice-versa. Cadastral data is dynamic by its nature; therefore it
                is impossible for any county to ever be considered complete. The data is NOT
                topologically enforced. As a statewide integrator, AGIO publishes the data but does
                not make judgment calls about where points or polygon lines are meant to be located.
                Therefore each county data set is published without topology rules being enforced.
                GIS Technicians use best practices such as polygon closure and vertex snapping,
                however, topology is not built for each county. Users should be aware, by Arkansas
                Law (15-21-504 2 B) digital cadastral data does not represent legal property
                boundary descriptions, nor is it suitable for boundary determination of the
                individual parcels included in the cadastre. Users requiring a boundary
                determination should consult an Arkansas Registered Land Surveyor
                (http://www.arkansas.gov/pels/search/search.php) on boundary questions. The digital
                cadastral data is intended to be a graphical representation of the tax parcel only.
                Just because a county is listed does NOT imply the data represents county wide
                coverage. AGIO worked with each county to determine a level of production that
                warranted the data was ready to be published. For example, in some counties only the
                north part of the county was covered or in other cases only rural parcels are
                covered and yet in others only urban parcels. The approach is to begin incremental
                publishing as production blocks are ready, even though a county may not have county
                wide coverage. Each case represents a significant amount of data that will be useful
                immediately. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to determine the
                age of the data for a given county. This date reflects when the data was received
                from the county. Digital cadastral data users should be aware the County Assessor
                Mapping Program adopted a phased approach for developing cadastral data. Phase One
                includes the production of a parcel centroid for each parcel that bears the
                attributes prescribed by the state cadastral mapping standard. Phase Two includes
                the production of parcel polygon geometry and bears the standard attributes. The
                Arkansas standard closely mirrors the federal Cadastral Core Data Standard
                established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, Subcommittee for Cadastral
                Data. Counties within this file include: Arkansas, Ashley, Baxter, Benton, Boone,

        <description>This is a graphic representation of the data stewards based on PLSS Townships
                in PLSS areas. In non-PLSS areas the metadata at a glance is based on a data steward
                defined polygons such as a city or county or other units. The identification of the
                data steward is a general indication of the agency that will be responsible for
                updates and providing the authoritative data sources. In other implementations this
                may have been termed the alternate source, meaning alternate to the BLM. But in the
                shared environment of the NSDI the data steward for an area is the primary
                coordinator or agency responsible for making updates or causing updates to be made.
                The data stewardship polygons are defined and provided by the data
                steward.</description>

        <description>Special Surveys are non-rectangular PLSS survey areas from BLM survey records.
                These features are not populated for the Ohio data set because at the time of the
                PLSS Surveys in Ohio, the non-rectangular survey types had not been established. In
                eastern states there are commonly land surveys established prior to PLSS survey that
                are contained in the Survey System feature class because they are not part of the
                PLSS. PLSS Special surveys are a component of the PLSS but are not

        <description>A Survey System is a named or numbered area of land that can be identified by a
                type and a designator. The survey system is generally a simultaneous conveyance that
                defines an area of land within which there is a consistent method of land
                description. The survey systems included lands that were established prior to PLSS
                survey and were not included in the public domain lands. Non-rectangular components
                of the PLSS are in the PLSS Special Surveys feature class. The first, second and

        <description>The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic
                and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage
                for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the
                coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census
                TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between
                parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an
                independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The
                2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical
                features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information
                distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There
                are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points,
                and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.
                Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as
                feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature
                types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,
                latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point
                features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.</description>

        <description> The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are
                an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census
                Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
                Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national
                file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is
                designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover
                the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block
                delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract
                that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same
                decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,..,
                3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.
                Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum
                size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census
                Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated
                BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census
                Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a
                contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely
                numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs
                never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other
                geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts,
                congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian
                areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only
                include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas,
                coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a
                census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile
                limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline
                or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and
                BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered
                census tract areas. </description>

        <description> The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are
                an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census
                Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
                Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national
                file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is
                designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover
                the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block
                delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract
                that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same
                decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,..,
                3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.
                Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum
                size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census
                Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated
                BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census
                Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a
                contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely
                numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs
                never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other
                geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts,
                congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian
                areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only
                include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas,
                coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a
                census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile
                limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline
                or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and
                BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered
                census tract areas. </description>

                TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the
                Census. The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and
                cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage
                for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the
                coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999
                TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the
                United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the
                Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas.
                The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or
                gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand
                alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole
                Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments
                representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The
                files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial
                objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the
                shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate
                software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files
                includes tributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used
                to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and
                statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features,
                landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area
                boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the
                fields in the 17 record types.The subject file represents Census Tracts 2000 for the
                State of Arkansas.</description>

        <description>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The
                U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Database (NED). The NED is
                a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data
                for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition
                to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were
                developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to the NAD83
                datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the
                effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for
                calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives.</description>

                meter posting DEMs, in standard USGS format, required to provide coverage of the
                National Forest. The mosaic is available in ERDAS Imagine .img format (version 8.5)
                and ESRI GRID format. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by
                the USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster form. The
                standard USGS format DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a
                designated coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series of
                profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each profile is in
                regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data is by columns and
                rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with
                the order of the columns from west to east. Each standard USGS DEM provides the same
                coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle without over edge.</description>

        <description>Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a representation of the topography of the
                Earth surface in digital format. The data is made up of sampled arrays of pixels
                depicting surface elevations in raster form. This data was captured as an ancillary
                product of a statewide ortho image acquisition using a Lecia ADS40 sensor. The
                primary DEM is a 5-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of
                latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator
                projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent
                of the DEM is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over edge ranges from a
                minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary
                and secondary corner points. The over edge is included to facilitate for the
                placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. This series of DEM's was
                produced as a part of the 2006 Arkansas Digital Orthophotography Program
                administered by the Arkansas State Land Information Board and the Arkansas
                Geographic Information Office. The aerial imaging data used to create the DEM was

        <description>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. A
                Digital Elevation Model (DEM), consists of a sampled array of elevations for ground
                positions that are normally at regularly spaced intervals. The 1-Degree DEM (3- by
                3-arc-second data spacing) provides coverage in 1- by 1-degree blocks for all of the
                contiguous United States, Hawaii, and limited portions of Alaska. The basic
                elevation model is produced by or for the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA), but is
                distributed by the USGS, EROS Data Center, in the DEM data record format. In
                reformatting the product the USGS does not change the basic elevation information.
                1-degree DEM's are also referred to as """"""""""""""""3-arc second""""""""""""""""
                or """"""""""""""""1:250,000 scale"""""""""""""""" DEM data. Elevations are in

        <description>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. The
                Hillshade (Shaded Relief) dataset is a derived product from the USGS National
                Elevation Dataset. The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation
                Database (NED). The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The
                7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial
                source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient
                processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing
                data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at
                quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved
                base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic
                derivatives.</description>

        <description>The Nature Conservancy’s vision is to conserve portfolios of functional
                conservation areas within and across ecoregions. Through this portfolio approach, we
                will work with partners to conserve a full array of ecosystems and viable native
                species . An ecoregional portfolio, the end product of ecoregional planning, is a
                selected set of places that represents the full distribution and diversity of native
                species, natural communities and ecosystems in an ecoregion. Designing
                ecoregion-based portfolios is a complex, iterative process based on five steps: *
                Identifying the species, communities and ecosystems in an ecoregion; * Setting
                specific goals for the number and distribution of these conservation targets to be
                captured in the portfolio; * Assembling information and relevant data on the
                location and quality of conservation targets; * Designing a network of conservation
                areas that most effectively meets the goals; and * Identifying the highest priority
                conservation areas, wide-ranging targets and pervasive threats for conservation
                action.</description>

        <description>Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type,
                quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a
                spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of
                ecosystems and ecosystem components. By recognizing the spatial differences in the
                capacities and potentials of ecosystems, ecoregions stratify the environment by its
                probable response to disturbance (Bryce, Omernik, and Larsen, 1999). Ecoregions are
                general purpose regions that are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem
                management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment
                organizations that are responsible for different types of resources in the same
                geographical areas (Omernik and others, 2000). A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme
                has been adopted for different levels of ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest
                level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the
                continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group,
                1997). At level III, the continental United States contains 104 ecoregions and the
                conterminous United States has 84 ecoregions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
                [USEPA], 2003). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of level III
                ecoregions. Methods used to define the USEPA's ecoregions are explained in Omernik
                (1995), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989). The approach used
                to compile the ecoregions of Arkansas is based on the premise that ecological
                regions can be identified through the analysis of the spatial patterns and the
                composition of biotic and abiotic characteristics that affect or reflect differences
                in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken, 1986; Omernik, 1987, 1995). These
                characteristics include geology, physiography, climate, soils, land use, wildlife,
                fish, hydrology, and vegetation (including "potential natural vegetation" defined by
                Küchler (p. 2, 1964) as "vegetation that would exist today" if human influence ended
                and "the resulting plant succession" was "telescoped into a single moment"). The
                relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to
                another regardless of ecoregion hierarchical level. In Arkansas, there are 7 level
                III ecoregions and 32 level IV ecoregions; all but four of these level IV ecoregions
                are also found in ecologically similar parts of adjacent states (Chapman and others,
                2002, 2004a, 2004b; Griffith, Omernik, and Azevedo, 1998). Arkansas' ecological
                diversity is strongly related to regional physiography, geology, soil, climate, and
                land use. Elevated karst plateaus, folded mountains, agricultural valleys, forested
                uplands, and bottomland forests occur. Fire-maintained prairie was once extensive in
                several parts of the state. The ecoregion were compiled at a scale of 1:250,000, and
                depict revisions and subdivisions of earlier level III ecoregions that were
                originally compiled at a smaller scale (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2003;
                Omernik, 1987). It is part of a collaborative project primarily between USEPA Region
                6, USEPA-National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (Corvallis,
                Oregon), and the Multi-Agency Wetland Planning Team (MAWPT), which comprises
                representatives of six Arkansas state agencies (Arkansas Natural Heritage
                Commission, Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Arkansas Game and Fish
                Commission, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Forestry
                Commission, and University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service). Collaboration
                and consultation also occurred with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S.
                Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S.
                Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USGS-Earth Resources
                Observation Systems Data Center, and University of Arkansas-Center for Advanced
                Spatial Technologies. This project is associated with an interagency effort to
                develop a common framework of ecological regions (McMahon and others, 2001).
                Reaching that objective requires recognition of the differences in the conceptual
                approaches and mapping methodologies applied to develop the most common
                ecoregion-type frameworks, including those developed by the U.S. Department of
                Agriculture-Forest Service (Bailey and others, 1994), the USEPA (Omernik 1987,
                1995), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Soil Conservation Service (1981). As
                each of these frameworks is further refined, their differences are becoming less
                discernible. Each collaborative ecoregion project, such as this one in Arkansas, is
                a step toward attaining consensus and consistency in ecoregion frameworks for the
                entire nation. Comments and questions regarding the Level III and IV Ecoregions of
                Arkansas should be addressed to Alan Woods, Oregon State University, c/o US EPA.,

        <description>This open-file report presents the results of the USGS Mineral Resources
                Program activity to compile a national-scale geologic map database to support
                national and regional level projects, including mineral resource and
                geo-environmental assessments. The only comprehensive sources of regional- and
                national-scale geologic maps are state geologic maps with scales ranging from
                1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000. Digital versions of these state maps form the core of what
                is presented here. Because no adequate geologic map exists for the state of Alaska,
                it is being compiled in regional blocks that also form part of this national
                database. It is expected that this series will completed by approximately the end of
                2007. These maps and databases are being released in blocks of states or, in the
                case of Alaska, as compiled blocks of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles as chapters in
                this series. For Alaska, formal maps as well as databases are being published here,
                whereas for the conterminous U.S. only state databases and preview graphics are
                presented, because published maps for most states already exist. For Alaska these
                regional compilations will form the base for compiling a new geologic map of the
                state. As documented in Chapter A, standards for the conterminous U.S. are somewhat
                different than those for Alaska and Hawaii.</description>

        <description>The Digital Geologic Quadrangle Maps (DGM) series is a collection of geologic
                maps produced at a 1:24,000 scale. Most of these maps were produced in cooperation
                with the USGS through Cooperative Geologic Mapping Programs. Each map contains
                geologic formation contacts, fault, structure, and attitude of bedding (strike and
                dip) data at a 1:24,000 scale. Also included on most of the maps are a
                cross-section, correlation and description of map units, references, and a
                stratigraphic column for the quadrangle.</description>

        <description>The collarless hillshaded DRGs are hillshaded using the National Elevation
                Dataset (NED). The NED is a raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey.
                NED is designed to provide National elevation data in a seamless form with a
                consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections were made in the
                NED assembly process to minimize artifacts, perform edge matching, and fill sliver
                areas of missing data. NED has a resolution of one arc-second (approximately 30
                meters) for the continuous United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.
                They are the same resolution as the 1:24,000 collarless DRGs, which has an
                approximate cell size of 2.4 meters, but hillshaded to give the maps a
                three-dimensional perspective. The collarless hillshade DRGs were created using a
                sequence of programs developed by Robert Weih. </description>

        <description>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov. These
                data can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) for any number of purposes
                such as assessing wildlife habitat, water quality, pesticide runoff, land use
                change, etc. The State data sets are provided with a 300 meter buffer beyond the
                State border to facilitate combining the State files into larger regions. The user
                must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting
                limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat
                satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and
                supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The analysis and
                interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes
                multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small
                number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were
                necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy
                assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of
                contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or
                multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the
                region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to
                carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before
                attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation
                must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The
                Arkansas portion of the NLCD was created as part of a project area encompassing
                portions of Federal Region VI, including the states of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma,
                Louisiana, and Arkansas. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover
                categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a
                cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S.
                Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data
                layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data
                purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC
                Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data.
                Partners include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water
                Resources Divisions), US EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and
                Atmospheric Administration.</description>

        <description>Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the
                geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophoto quadrangle (DOQ) is a
                1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75
                minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection
                (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ
                is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over edge ranges from a minimum of 50
                meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary
                corner points. The over edge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicing
                and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal
                orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a
                series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to
                south. This series of DOQs was produced as a part of the Arkansas Digital
                Orthophotography Program headed by the Arkansas State Land Information Board and the
                Arkansas Geographic Information Office. The aerial photography used to create the
                digital images was flown between January 15th and March 31st during 2000-2002. The
                images make use of three separate spectral bands to form a color infrared composite,
                which allows easier analysis of agriculture, land use, vegetation, and other
                features with infrared reflectance. Areas of high vegetative vigor appear bright red
                in color infrared imagery.</description>

                Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric
                qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter
                ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of
                longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the
                North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent
                to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a
                maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner
                points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for
                the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation
                of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of
                pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south.
                The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from
                0 to 255. This dataset is a combination of all DOQ images from the State of
                Arkansas. They have been stitched into a single mosaic through an automated process
                using ER Mapper software from Earth Resource Mapping Pty Ltd. The DOQ images were
                contrast balanced (using histogram matching) and the resulting balanced mosaic was
                forced into a value range of 0 to 255 using a simple linear
                transformation.</description>

        <description>This file represents the 2006 Color-Infrared Digital Ortho footprint and
                contains image dates. Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph
                with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophoto quarter
                quadrangle (DOQQ) is a1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of
                latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse
                Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The
                geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over
                edge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the
                extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The over edge is included to
                facilitate tonal matching for mosaicing and for the placement of the NAD83 and
                secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and
                samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east
                with the order of the lines from north to south. This series of DOQQs was produced
                as a part of the Arkansas Digital Orthophotography Program headed by the Arkansas
                State Land Information Board and the Arkansas Geographic information Office. The
                aerial photography used to create the digital images was flown between January 15th
                and March 31st in 2006.</description>

        <description>The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic
                and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The geographic coverage
                for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the
                coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census
                TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between
                parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an
                independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The
                2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical
                features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information
                distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There
                are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points,
                and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.
                Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as
                feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature
                types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities,
                latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point
                features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.</description>

        <description>A ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTA) is a statistical geographic entity that
                approximates the delivery area for a U.S. Postal Service five-digit or three-digit
                ZIP Code. ZCTAs are aggregations of census blocks that have the same predominant ZIP
                Code associated with the addresses in the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File
                (MAF). Three-digit ZCTA codes are applied to large contiguous areas for which the
                U.S. Census Bureau does not have five-digit ZIP Code information in its MAF. ZCTAs
                do not precisely depict ZIP Code delivery areas, and do not include all ZIP Codes
                used for mail delivery. </description>

        <description>The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of
                selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's
                Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing
                (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no
                overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to
                stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire
                nation. ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of
                U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to
                present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates
                ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the
                Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each
                decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify
                the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP
                Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. The Census Bureau uses tabulation
                blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA
                based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within
                that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit
                numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros. Blocks that do not
                contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the
                surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring
                ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP
                Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with
                the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code
                within any of the blocks where it exists. The ZCTA boundaries in this release are
                those delineated following the 2010 Census.</description>

        <description>Jails and Prisons (Correctional Institutions) in Arkansas The Jails and Prisons
                sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the Critical
                Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility or location where
                individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against their will. This includes
                Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as well
                as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps, including camps
                operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal
                Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration
                of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or
                territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer
                than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the incarceration of
                those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually 18 years). A Local Jail
                is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72
                hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees. A temporary holding
                facility, sometimes referred to as a "police lock up" or "drunk tank", is a facility
                used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that are administrative
                offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent
                with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their "National Jail Census",
                with the exception of "temporary holding facilities", which the DOJ excludes. If the
                facility is enclosed with a fence, wall, or structure with a gate around the
                buildings only, the locations were depicted as ONENTITY at the entrance. If the
                facility's buildings are not enclosed, the locations were depicted as ONENTITY on
                the building or BLOCKFACE on the correct street segment. Personal homes,
                administrative offices and temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this
                dataset, but a few may be included. Personal homes of constables may exist due to
                the fact that many constables work out of their home. With the merge of the Law
                Enforcement and the Correctional Institutions datasets, the NAICS Descriptions were
                assigned based on the facility's main function, which were determined by the
                entity's name, facility type, web research and state supplied data. For records
                where the entity's name represents both datasets, the NAICS Description was assigned
                based on the specifications of the dataset the record is assigned to. Text fields in
                this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database
                engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde)
                have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use
                with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this
                dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the
                oldest record dates from 2006/06/28 and the newest record dates from 2008/02/19 </description>

        <description>Locations of Dams in Arkansas as provided to the Arkansas Natural Resources
                Commission by the Army Corp of Engineers. This database represents a collection of
                permitted dam locations in Arkansas. Dams within the State of Arkansas fall under a
                permit process established under Arkansas Code 15-22-201. All dams with height of 25
                or more feet and containing 50 acre-feet or more of storage at normal pool must have
                a valid construction and operation permit from the Commission, unless they are owned
                by the United States Government. If smaller dams pose a threat to life or property,
                they may also require regulation by the State based on a petition by downstream
                landowners and results of a public hearing. Dams are defined as: Any barrier,
                including one for flood detention, designed to impound liquid volumes. This shall
                not include highway, railroad or other roadway embankments, including low water
                crossings that may temporarily detain floodwater, levees designed to prevent
                inundation by floodwater, or closed dikes to temporarily impound liquids in the
                event of emergencies and those barriers not exempt by Sections 701.3 or 701.4 of

        <description> Law Enforcement Locations in Arkansas Any location where sworn officers of a
                law enforcement agency are regularly based or stationed. Law Enforcement agencies
                "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer
                with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of
                Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement
                Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only
                includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for Federal, state,
                local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law Enforcement agencies
                include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state police,
                school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies,
                departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement
                (e.g. US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g. Port
                Authority Police). Although TGS' intention is to only include locations associated
                with agencies that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few locations
                that are associated with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS is deleting
                these locations as we become aware of them, but some probably still exist in this
                dataset. Generally the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law
                enforcement officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are
                not chartered or licensed by their state. County, city and other government
                authorities within each state are generally empowered by their state law to setup or
                disband Law Enforcement agencies. Never the less, the agencies have visibility to
                state level authorities because generally sworn Law Enforcement officers must report
                to the state the agency they are employed by. TGS did not verify any state
                attributes, only the name, physical street address, city, state, five digit zip
                code, phone number and location were verified through phone contact. At the request
                of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate
                consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics
                (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest
                equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not
                support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE]

        <description> Large Protestant Churches in Arkansas The Large Protestant Churches dataset is
                composed of any type of building where Protestant Christians congregate as an
                organization to worship. In cases where membership or attendance figures were
                available, churches were selected for inclusion that had 750 or more members or
                attendees. In cases where such figures were not available, churches were selected
                based upon the population of the city that appears in their address. In this case,
                only churches in cities with 100,000 or more population were included. The
                Protestant Churches dataset should not include Non Christian, Roman Catholic,
                Eastern Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and related churches of their
                descendants that split from the Roman Catholic church. Also not included in this
                dataset are homes of church representatives, schools and any type of administrative
                buildings. This dataset is comprised entirely of non licensed restricted data that
                was obtained through TGS original research. TGS has ceased making phone calls to
                verify information about religious locations. Therefore all entities in this dataset
                were “verified” using alternative reference sources, such as topo maps, parcel maps,
                various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how)
                attribute for these entities has been set to “ALT REF”. The text fields in this

                search results. Non printable and control characters were removed from all text
                fields. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been
                replaced with their closest equivalent English character. This was done to

        <description> Roman Catholic Churches In Large Cities in Arkansas This dataset includes
                buildings where Roman Catholics gather for organized worship in cities with a
                population of 50,000 people or more. Roman Catholic Churches are Christian Churches
                that are subject to the papal authority in Rome. In addition to what are commonly
                thought of as Roman Catholic Churches, this data set also includes Newman (or
                Neumann) Centers and Chaldean Churches. Newman Centers are Roman Catholic Churches
                setup specifically to serve college or university populations. The Chaldean Church
                (also known as the Chaldean Church of Babylon) reunited with the Catholic Church in
                the 15th century. It originated in the Middle East. If a group of Roman Catholics
                gather for organized worship at a location that also serves another function, such
                as a school, these locations are included in this dataset if they otherwise meet the
                criteria for inclusion. Roman Catholic Shrines are included if they hold regularly
                scheduled mass. If a congregation celebrates mass at multiple locations, we have
                tried to include all such locations. This dataset excludes churches that are not
                subject to papal authority in Rome. Some churches may refer to themselves as
                "Catholic", and yet not be part of the "Roman" Catholic Church and these Churches
                are excluded from this dataset. Specifically Protestant Churches and their
                descendants which separated from the Roman Catholic Church beginning in 1517,
                Eastern Orthodox Churches (e.g. Russian, Greek) which separated from the Roman
                Catholic Church in 1054, and Episcopalian (Church of England in America) which
                separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 are excluded. The 22 "Eastern
                Catholic autonomous particular churches", with the exception of the Chaldean Church,
                are also excluded. These are Churches which are in full communion with the Pope in
                Rome, but which practice their own rites which are different from the Western or
                Latin Roman Catholic Church. This dataset excludes rectories. Private homes, even if
                they are used for formal worship, are excluded from this dataset. Locations that are
                only used for administrative purposes are also excluded. This dataset also includes
                original TGS research. All data is non license restricted data. TGS has ceased
                making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore all
                entities in this dataset were “verified” using alternative reference sources, such
                as topo maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The
                [CONTHOW] (contact how) attribute for these entities has been set to “ALT REF”. Text
                fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent
                database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the

        <description>This data set contains Functional Classification roads for the State of
                Arkansas per the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). This file
                should only be used as a graphical representation and for general reporting. Field
                verification and source contact should always occur prior to financial planning
                taking place. Functional classification is the process by which streets and highways
                are grouped into classes, or systems, according to the character of service they are
                intended to provide. Basic to this process is the recognition that individual roads
                and streets do not serve travel independently in any major way. Rather, most travel
                involves movement through a network of roads. It becomes necessary then to determine
                how this travel can be channelized within the network in a logical and efficient
                manner. Functional classification defines the nature of this channelization process
                by defining the part that any particular road or street should play in serving the
                flow of trips through a highway network.</description>

                include all of the runways associated with the 6734 airports in the companion
                airport data set Airports, 1998 (BTS). Data were obtained from the Federal Aviation
                Administration's (FAA) National Flight Data Center (NFDC) 5010 landing facilities
                data (January 1999). Landing facilities in this database consist of those identified
                in the NFDC 5010 database to be either publicly owned, or privately owned but open
                to the public, or owned by the U.S. military. The following landing facilities have
                been excluded: private landing facilities not open to the public, glider ports and
                ultra light landing facilities, as well as landing facilities that do not have a
                current LOCID assigned to them. Horizontal positional accuracy is based on
                coordinate data provided in the NFDC 5010 database. These coordinate data identify
                the approximate location of the Airport Reference Point (ARP) as reported by the
                landing facility on the NFDC 5010 form. According to NFDC guidelines, the location
                of the ARP should be reported to a horizontal accuracy of one arc second of latitude
                and longitude. However, the accuracy of these reported coordinates are not verified
                by FAA. The scale is unknown.</description>

        <description>The Off-System are routes on AHTD's Linear Referencing System (LRS) that for
                the most part are not part of the State Highway System but qualify for Federal Aid
                because they are on the Functional Class System. The AHTD identifies these routes on
                the LRS because they are required to report condition, events, assets, etc. on them.
                The majority of the routes are county routes and city streets. However, we also put
                Frontage Roads, Ramps, Institutional Drives (College Campus Roads, Hospital Roads,

        <description>This data set contains regions representing areal NHD hydrographic waterbody
                features. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that
                interconnects and uniquely identifies the sream segments or reaches that comprise
                the nation's surface water drainage system. Medium resolution NHD is based on the
                content of the U.S. Geological Survey 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG)
                hydrography data, integrated with reach-related information from the U.S.
                Environmental Protection Agency Reach File Version 3.0 (RF3). More specifically, it
                contains reach codes for networked features and isolated lakes, flow direction,
                names, stream level, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches
                are also defined to represent water bodies and the approximate shorelines of the
                Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also

        <description>This is the Ozark - St. Francis National Forests Wild and Scenic River Cooridor
                polygon layer. In Apil 1992, Congress designated six Wild and Scenic Rivers on the
                Ozark - St. Francis National Forests. These rivers include: Big Piney Creek, the
                Buffalo River, Hurricane Creek, Mulberry River, North Sylamore Creek and Richland
                Creek. These areas include approximately 19,859 acres of the Ozark - St. Francis
                National Forests. This MA is unsuitable for timber prduction. The total miles of
                Wild and Scenic River designation is 162.5 miles.</description>
