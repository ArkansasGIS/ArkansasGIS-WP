                      <p><strong>Status of the ASLIB Local Government Board representatives&rsquo; appointments</strong><br />
                        Chair sent email correspondence regarding reappointments of  Board members.&nbsp;&nbsp; Governor&rsquo;s Office  response was researching and interest of other candidates.</p>
                      <p><strong>AGIO Report</strong></p>
                      <p>Shelby  provided an update on AGIO activities of late.&nbsp;  The primary activity for Shelby and Learon during the interim period  with short staff has been to continue GeoStor operations and to meet the  minimum needs of the counties participating in the road centerline grant.&nbsp; He also reported the AGIO is complete with  its administrative and physical transfer to the Department of Information  Systems.</p>
                      <p>Shelby  then provided a brief on Adrian Clark and Maria Baker including their  backgrounds, expertise and the work they will be undertaking.&nbsp; Their initial assignments include the  completion of AGIO quality control, standard assessment and evaluation of the  road centerline files being sent by the counties which are completing their  road centerline grant.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p><strong>Old Business &ndash;</strong><br />
                        Road Centerline Grant Extension Crittenden, Greene &amp;  Saline counties.</p>
                      <p>Shelby  provided a short update on the status in each of the three counties that  required an extension to their grant delivery. He described that AGIO had taken  additional measures working with the grant extension counties including first  hand meetings, teleconference calls and increased status monitoring.</p>
                      <p>Crittenden   County is working forward  and their contractor is preparing the data to meet their deadline.&nbsp; Shelby met  with the contractor at length in West    Memphis to review their existing data and  approach.&nbsp; Shelby  stated he believed Crittenden   County will be delivered  on time and meet the standard.</p>
                      <p>In the case of Greene   County the contractor was  very close to completion and only required a short amount of time to complete.  AGIO is confident that Greene   County will be completed  on time and meet the state standard.</p>
                      <p>In the case of Saline   County the contractor is  continuing work on the file.&nbsp; The draft  file submitted needed additional work to both the spatial and attribute  information.&nbsp; The contractor working on Saline County  has added personnel resources to meet their proposed deadline and AGIO is  confident they will meet both the deadline and the state standard.</p>
                      <p><strong>New Business &ndash;</strong><br />
                          <strong>Road Centerline data  development completing Arkansas</strong></p>
                      <p>Shelby  provided a detailed description of the status of the statewide road centerline  data set.&nbsp; This included a description of  the situation concerning the five counties remaining incomplete.</p>
                      <p>They include Calhoun, Newton  and Izard counties these three counties remaining in Arkansas that do not have physical  addressing or E9-1-1.&nbsp; Cleveland County  which has physical addressing but no road centerline mapping and Faulkner County which has physical addressing but  no county wide centerline data.&nbsp; The City  of Conway, which is the Faulkner County  seat has road centerline data created and maintained for Conway Corp.&nbsp; There was a data mapping effort in Faulkner County but the data county data has not  been submitted to AGIO.&nbsp; Shelby  stated he believed Faulkner   County was eligible for  the grant but did not apply.</p>
                      <p>In the case of Calhoun and Izard counties, Shelby stated he met with county officials in  both those counties and they are very interested in pursuing the conversion to  physical addressing and centerline mapping but they do not have the funds  necessary to complete the projects alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shelby also met with Newton County.  However the county officials were less optimistic about completing both  physical address conversion and centerline mapping without complete state  support.</p>
                      <p>Shelby  closed the discussion stating the GIS Trust Fund had $223,000 in funding  available and that AGIO recommended utilizing up to $200,000 of that reserve to  accelerate the completion of centerlines in the remaining counties.&nbsp; This step would be in line with the Board&rsquo;s  priority data sets of centerlines, parcels and orthoimagery.&nbsp; The issue at hand is the AGIO does not  believe this is enough funding to complete all the remaining counties.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>Russell Gibson questioned what would the cost be?&nbsp; The response was that each county requiring  physical address conversion and mapping could be up to $150,000 each.&nbsp; Then roughly $25,000 to $30,000 would be  needed to complete Faulkner and Cleveland counties.</p>
                      <p>Bekki White questioned the feasibility of requesting General  Improvement Funds in the next legislative session to finish the project.&nbsp; Shelby  remarked the General Assembly did pass a General Improvement Bill that included  $750,000 of appropriation but no funding was received during the last  legislative session and so the mechanism is in place but not the funding.</p>
                      <p>The Board concluded the discussion with the following tasks  assigned to AGIO:<br />
  &nbsp;1) Request the  General Improvement funding through the Governor&rsquo;s Office to complete the  project;<br />
  &nbsp;2) Complete a  detailed cost analysis of the remaining counties to refine the costs and report  that to the Board.</p>
                      <p>Phyllis Poch&eacute; stated the strategy moving forward would be to  request the General Improvement funding, if that becomes available the Board  will act, if the funding is not available then the board will study the refined  costs and consider leveraging the GIS Trust fund to complete as many of the  counties as money allowed.&nbsp; AGIO is to  report the detailed costs analysis and General Improvement funding status back  to the Board via email as soon as possible.</p>
                      <p><strong>Designation of the  Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality as the State Steward for the  National Hydro Data (NHD) Set</strong></p>
                      <p>Phyllis Poch&eacute; acknowledged Bill Sneed, the USGS liaison, to  present a brief presentation on the development and history of the NHD and  additional background on each state designating a state steward for NHD.</p>
                      <p>Bill reported the following details to the Board.</p>
                      <p>The NHD was completed through a major investment by both  U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&nbsp; The data set is based upon the 1:24000 scale  USGS quad map series.&nbsp; Information built  includes stream classification, location, other features such as reservoirs,  ponds, lakes and the flow network of the stream data.&nbsp; The powerful data set allows both upstream  and downstream analysis within a GIS.&nbsp;  Moving forward the USGS proposed strategy is that data needed to be  maintained over time and those users closest to the data are best suited to  identify and report errors or improvements.&nbsp;  Through this recognition they developed a national strategy whereby they  would identify state based organizations that could act as the primary steward  for the data in each state.&nbsp;&nbsp; These  stewards would work with other local data users to identify and report errors  based upon the state&rsquo;s business needs with the data.</p>
                      <p>With that background Bill then explained that he partnered  with the AGIO, and Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to host  a series of NHD workshops and training across the state.&nbsp; There were two series of workshops held, one  for managers and one for GIS specialists.&nbsp;  Over 60 personnel attended the workshops held in northwest and central Arkansas.&nbsp; Following these workshops ADEQ emerged as a  logical state steward for NHD.&nbsp;  Subsequent to that USGS and ADEQ jointly developed a Memorandum of Understanding  to cooperate on NHD.&nbsp; This activity also  included pilot project funding in the amount of $40,000 to study one cataloging  unit and identify issues, challenges and use that result to prepare a  feasibility report on ADEQ&rsquo;s ability to fulfill the State NHD Stewardship  role.&nbsp; Bill concluded by stating that at  this point USGS supported the strategy for the State Land Information Board to  designate the ADEQ as the State Steward for NHD.</p>
                      <p>Chairwoman Poch&eacute; then recognized Karen Bassett, Deputy  Director of ADEQ, to provide additional comments and background to the Board.&nbsp; Deputy Director Bassett described ADEQ&rsquo;s intent  to adopt NHD as the agency&rsquo;s core data set that would serve as a backbone to  all water related databases within the agency.&nbsp;  It was their hope that if ADEQ served the leadership role that all other  state agencies would also utilize NHD as the state&rsquo;s common data set for water  related information.&nbsp; To this end she  requested that a working group be formed based upon a number of state  stakeholders that could report their intent to use NHD.&nbsp; Board Member, Tracy   Moy of the Arkansas Game &amp; Fish Commission reported that  her agency was using NHD and intending to continue using NHD.&nbsp; She believed several other agencies would as  well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Board Member Bekki White remarked that her agency intended to use  NHD and to cooperate with ADEQ on this data set but was concerned by the  inclusion of water wells within the USGS &amp; ADEQ Memorandum of Understanding.&nbsp; She stated this appeared to be a duplication  of effort.&nbsp; Bill Sneed replied this was  an oversight and that should be corrected.&nbsp;  That NHD only referred to surface water features within the data.&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>Additional discussion followed which was brought to a close  by the Chair who requested that AGIO work with Deputy Director Bassett to issue  a letter to agency directors requesting they or their designee participate in a  workgroup to identify what water data sets agencies were using. If not NHD,  what measures would lead them to use NHD and what coordination could  result?&nbsp; The agencies listed included  Arkansas Geological Survey, Game &amp; Fish Commission, Natural Resource  Commission, Natural Heritage, Highway &amp; Transportation, Environmental  Quality, Emergency Management and&hellip;<br />
                        Deputy Director Bassett and Shelby pledged to work together  and report back to the Board.</p>
                      <p><strong>Letter of Endorsement  for the Rural GIS Program</strong><br />
                        Chairwoman Poch&eacute; reported to the Board that Resource  Geographic Information System (RGIS) program outreach coordinator Brian  Culpepper had contacted her regarding a letter of endorsement for continuation  of the program.&nbsp; This program supports a  number of statewide GIS coordination activities within Arkansas and assists with GIS education and  outreach.&nbsp; The Chair prepared a draft  letter and requested the Board&rsquo;s concurrence with sending the support letter.  The Board responded with their support.</p>
                      <p>With no further business the Chair entertained a motion to  adjourn.&nbsp; Motion to adjourn by Randy  Everett, motioned seconded by Russell Gibson, with no discussion the motion  passed.&nbsp; Meeting adjourned at 5:37pm</p>
                      <p><strong>Next  Board Meeting December 5, 2007</strong> Location to be Determined</p>
