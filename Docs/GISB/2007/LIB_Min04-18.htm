                          Mr.  Bill Sneed<br />
                          Mr.  Joe Clements Jr.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Agenda</em></strong><br />
                          Meeting called to order by Chair Poch&eacute; at 9:38am. </p>
                        <p>Board members and Advisory Panel Members welcomed  to meeting by Chair.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                          The minutes of the March 16th, 2007  meetings were approved.<br />
  <strong>Motion:</strong> Bekki White  motioned approval of the minutes
                          dated 03/16/07.<br />
  <strong>Second:</strong> Rob Kissell seconded the motion.&nbsp; No discussion,
                        the motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Elections Chair &amp; Vice Chair </em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Judge Hudson motioned that the current  administration continue in their service to the Board<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Bekki White  seconded the motion.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Yancey has chosen to step down  from the Vice Chair position.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p><em>Judge  Hudson has withdrawn his motion and Bekki White  has withdrawn her second.</em></p>
                        <p>Nominations for Vice Chair: Tracy Moy<br />
                          She has accepted the  appointment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Judge Hudson motioned that Phyllis remain the  Chair and that Tracy Moy assume the  position of Vice-Chair.</p>
                        <p><strong>Second:</strong> Bekki White  seconded the motion.&nbsp; No discussion.&nbsp; Motion passes unanimously.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Discussion ensued about teleconference capability  and attendance to meetings.&nbsp; Does this  count as attendance to the meeting?&nbsp; The  rules concerning this will be investigated. Tracey Moy suggested setting an  individual rule that Board members can only use it once every 4 meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meetings will be scheduled farther in  advance to allow for more planning of attendance.&nbsp; The Chair desires a meeting with the Advisory  Panel. There needs to be a planned program to acquaint the new members with the  Board and renew our presence with the members who have been on the Panel from  its creation The Chair would like to have the Board members present at that  meeting.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Judge Hudson wants an organized notebook of  reference materials: names, affiliation/contact information, legislative  background, goals and objectives, purpose, money, grants, state budget  information, $ management information, acronyms..</p>
                        <p>Tracy Moy  suggested an orientation for new Board members. It would assist in bringing  them up to speed with the Board and its functions.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Judge Hudson stated that more work should be put on  the staff of AGIO as the Chair and Vice Chair have full time jobs and their  responsibility should be more of an advisory one as opposed to doing all the  work themselves.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong><em>Vacant private sector position and upcoming term expirations </em></strong></p>
                        <p>Bob Stanley  officially resigned from the Board due to professional conflicts.&nbsp; The Chair has transferred this information on  to the agency that governs Boards.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>In August of 2007 Mark Kay Sullivan, Judge Hudson,  and Russell Gibson&rsquo;s terms are  expiring.&nbsp; If they are willing to serve another  term they will need to make their intentions known for reappointment.</p>
                        <p>Robert Newell and Earl   Smith have both been absent from several Board Meetings now.  According to our legislation a letter should be sent to Michael McGrew for  missing more than 3 meetings in a row.&nbsp; Michael  handles the appointments to the SLIB.  The Chair has reminded the Mr. McGrew that appointees to this Board should be  familiar with the workings of this board and its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Bob Stanley&rsquo;s term  expires in 2008, and is from the Private Sector.&nbsp; His replacement will serve out the existing  term and then have the option to serve two full additional terms.</p>
                        <p>Kissell recommends Glen Dabney from Kingwood  Forestry in Monticello,  AR.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Randy Everett from First Electric Co-op has shown  interest in serving on the Board.&nbsp; He is  currently on the Advisory Panel.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Candidates will need to fill out an online  application. &nbsp;The Appointments to Boards  and Commissions department does consider recommendations from the Board on  nominations.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Discussion ensued about other possible nominations.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>AGIO report from State Geographic Information Coordinator </em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby described how the AGIO reporting structure will  change with ACT751, of this session, which abolished the Office of Information  Technology and sent GIS positions and duties under the Department of  Information Systems.&nbsp; The only change  that concerns the Board is that everywhere in our legislation is that  previously stated as Office of Information Technology to Department of  Information Systems.&nbsp; Claire Bailey,  director of DIS, has had Chief Technology Officer added to her title so that we  remain in compliance with OMB Circular A87.&nbsp;  Act 794 transfers the AGIO Agency Operations and Budget to DIS and the  AGIO will remain a General Revenue Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>The AGIO RIF &ndash; move to DIS 2nd week in May.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Discussion ensued on  what this legislation will do to the daily operations of the AGIO.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Statewide Digital Ortho-Photography Program (Act  1486)</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby passed out a summary of this bill to fund another  acquisition of Aerial Imagery.&nbsp; We have  received appropriation for this project but it was not funded through the  General Improvement Fund (GIF) bill by the session.&nbsp; Since we have the appropriation, if we are  able to find funding we will be able to conduct this project &ndash; but, timing  would most likely push this until the winter of 2009.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p><strong><u>Road centerline File Progress (Act 1514)</u></strong><br />
                          Summary was handed  out.&nbsp; As with Act 1486, the bill was  passed but not funded.&nbsp; This bill would  have issued a grant option to counties with physical addressing to complete  their centerlines.&nbsp; The 3 counties  without physical addressed would also be provided a grant option to create  physical addresses and build their centerlines.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p><strong><u>Surveying Legislation</u></strong> </p>
                        <p>Act 752 &ndash; Transfers the  Division of Land Surveys from the Commissioner of State Lands to the Department  of Agriculture</p>
                        <p>Act 1051 &ndash; Requires the  State Surveyor to refer complaints to the State Board of Registration for  Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors</p>
                        <p>Act 1040 &ndash; Requires Licensed  Surveyors to file a plat with the State Surveyors Office </p>
                        <p>This  Act could have the large impact on the County Assessor&rsquo;s  Offices with their cadastral mapping.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>SB 190 &ndash; Did not pass -  Would have placed a term limit on the position of State Surveyor</p>
                        <p>SB 433 &ndash; Automated  Mapping System &ndash; Watersheds &ndash; status is unknown at this time</p>
                        <p><strong><em>New Business </em></strong></p>
                        <p><strong><em>2008 National  Agriculture Imagery Program cooperative opportunity</em></strong> <br />
                          Function  carried out by the USDA FSA to fly the State leaf-on. Their 2006 data is being  loaded into GeoStor.&nbsp; They do not have  the funding to pay for the entire state in 2007 and are looking for additional  sources of funding to increase their coverage.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong><em>Cost estimate to  elevation improvement</em></strong> &ndash; to enforce hydro rules and put in break lines and to correct the  data for the entire state &ndash; is $999,000.&nbsp;  We do not currently have the resources to do this and even if we were  able to the data will still not meet FEMA&rsquo;s Guidelines for use in Detailed  Floodplain Studies.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Landuse/Landcover  cooperative opportunity</em></strong> &ndash; Identified   State and Federal  Agencies that would benefit having this data produced to try to find funding to  develop this dataset.&nbsp; Unfortunately we  are hitting the deadline to conduct this project.</p>
                        <p>Discussion  ensued on funding options and cooperative efforts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Bekki White motioned that the Board approve  reimbursement for travel to official Board meetings and activities in 2007.<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Yancey   Reynolds seconded the motion.&nbsp;  No discussion, the motion passed unanimously. </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Old Business </em></strong></p>
                        <p><strong><u>Dallas</u></strong><strong><u> County</u></strong><strong><u> Centerline Grant</u></strong></p>
                        <p>After  visiting with the Southwest Arkansas Planning &amp; Development District they  have revised their plans toward completing this project and other county&rsquo;s that  they are creating for the ACF Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><u>Tentative  dates for future meetings</u></strong></p>
                        <p>Next  meeting is scheduled for September 19th, 2007 during the Fall  Symposium in Eureka Springs. Time is TBD.&nbsp; </p>
