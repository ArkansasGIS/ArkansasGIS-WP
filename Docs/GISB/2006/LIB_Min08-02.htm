                        <p><strong><em>AGIO report  from State Geographic Information Coordinator </em></strong><br />
                          The  second quarter of 2006 calendar year has been filled with many activities and  projects surrounding GIS coordination throughout Arkansas.&nbsp;  The growth of GIS adoption, use and the coordinated development of  geospatial data for the state have steadily been growing.&nbsp; This is especially true at the County level.&nbsp; Detailed reports of the Road Centerline  Program and the County Assessor Mapping Program highlight those activities  later in this report.</p>
                        <p>Other  significant activities include the rollout and development of an on-line  application by the Arkansas Oil &amp; Gas Commission featuring gas well  production in the Fayetteville Shale Play.&nbsp;  GeoStor has played a key role in the growth of this play for the energy  companies involved.&nbsp; A number of  activities have started of late dealing with Education reform activities most  significantly associated with school district boundaries, and the potential  realignment of boundaries by the Arkansas General Assembly and or the State  Board of Education.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>The  Office is playing a coordination role in the following areas: </p>
                        <ul type="square">
                          <li>The development and       evaluation of a major addition to the State Information Technology       Planning process that is prepared by all state agencies prior to the       upcoming legislative session.&nbsp; The       revision requests substantially more detail about state agency GIS       resources, data, software, personnel and projects.&nbsp; Once compiled this information will be       included in a future report to the Board.</li>
                          <li>Development of a       statewide all hazards mitigation plan for the Arkansas Department of       Emergency Management.</li>
                          <li>Coordination for       the development of a statewide seamless data set representing the electric       utility service areas of the state.</li>
                          <li>Technical support       and assistance to the Arkansas Department of Economic Development for       increased utilization of geospatial resources, data and applications.</li>
                          <li>Continued coordination       and support to the Department of Finance and Administration for the       Streamlined Sales and Use Tax program.</li>
                          <li>Participation in       the Geospatial One-Stop Design Team for future version of the Geospatial       One-Stop Portal</li>
                          <li>Participation on       the National Academy of Science, Mapping Science Sub-Committee for a study       on Land Parcels A National Vision.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Finally  as a reminder, the State is hosting the National States Geographic Information  Council (NSGIC) Annual Conference in Little    Rock the first week of October.&nbsp; We would be especially encouraged to have as  many of the State Land Information Board  Members attend as possible.</p>

                          <h1>Status of the County   Assessor Mapping Program</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>The  following five Counties of Phase I parcel point data were recently loaded into  GeoStor.&nbsp; The Phase I data represents a  point location for each parcel that includes the parcel attributes in  accordance with the state and federal cadastral data standard.</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>Ashley</li>
                          <li>Chicot</li>
                          <li>Columbia </li>
                          <li>Lafayette </li>
                          <li>Little River</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This  brings us to a total of 17 Counties that have completed Phase I data which is  available on GeoStor.</p>
                        <p>We now  have six more Counties have taken Phase II training which involves mapping a  graphical representation of the parcel polygon.&nbsp;  The following counties recently completed this training.</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>Lincoln </li>
                          <li>Clark </li>
                          <li>Chicot</li>
                          <li>Columbia </li>
                          <li>Franklin </li>
                          <li>Sebastian</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Lincoln  County Phase I point data is scheduled to be loaded shortly</p>
                        <p>Cross,  Stone and Washington Counties Phase II parcel polygon data will be loaded  shortly.</p>
                        <div>
                          <h1>County Assessor Mapping Program Camp</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>The second  CAMPcamp is scheduled for September 12th and 13th of 2006  and is once again being held at the Arkansas  4H Camp in Ferndale, AR.&nbsp;  We will have in class training and time on the computers as well.&nbsp; Since this time around the mappers are in  various stages of data production (Phase I and II) the workshop will offer a  variety of sessions to accommodate the different phases and skill levels.</p>
                        <p>As of  Yesterday afternoon 35 counties have registered with 20 counties wishing to  send more than one attendant.&nbsp; Registration  closes Friday, August 4th.&nbsp; On  Monday, August 7th the AGIO will be contacting those counties that  requested additional personnel to attend to inform them if a slot is  available.&nbsp; The costs for attendants this  round is $25 for the 1st attendant from a county and $125 for each  additional attendant from a county.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Funding  has been allocated from MAGIC, AGIO and ACD to help defray the cost of the  workshop.&nbsp; So far the response has been  very positive and we hope for a great 2 day workshop for the CAMPers.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The grant program was broken into two rounds over  the course of the last year.&nbsp; Although  they were eligible the counties of Desha, Lawrence and Pope choose not to  participate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Round 1</strong>:&nbsp;  13 counties for a total of $306,952.&nbsp; All are in various stages of  development except for Arkansas  which was submitted on June 26.&nbsp; The quality assurance report was issued  8/1/2006.

                          21% of the state is in the process of being rectified<br />
                          21% of  the state has been through the aerial triangulation process<br />
                          19% of  the state is in the process of being aerial triangulated<br />
                          Similar  progress is also occurring on the counties participating in the 1 foot buy up  option.</p>
                        <p>AGIO  anticipates the delivery of some portions of the state to arrive in September.  All deliverables are still scheduled for December 31, 2006. AGIO staff will  quality control the product and plan to make it available the first quarter of  2007.</p>
                        <h1>Other news</h1>
                        <p>There  will be a NSGIC conference in the 1st week of October hosted in Little Rock.&nbsp; The AGIO recommends that if Board members  wish to go that the session that covered State summaries would be the best one  to attend.&nbsp; Learon will organize day  passes to those Board members who wish to attend.</p>

                            <strong>Legislation on city  boundary changes</strong><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several issues surrounding  City Boundary changes and how they are reported:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Police districts are based on land area and population</li>
                          <li>Turn back funds use city boundaries in their calculation</li>
                          <li>The pension review board now requires boundary changes to be filed with  SOS</li>
                          <li>Streamline sales and use tax &ndash; changes need to be reported to SOS to get  the appropriate sales tax applied to the annexed area (can mean loss of  revenue)</li>
                          <li>There are a variety of ways to report boundary changes, but only one requires  it to be reported to SOS</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Currently  there is no synchronized flow for reporting changes.&nbsp; The AGIO, who often work with municipal  boundaries, feels that the most efficient flow would be for the city clerk to  report changes to the county clerk, who then reports it to the SOS.&nbsp; The Board needs to decide if they want to pursue  this change in reporting procedures as an initiative.&nbsp; If so the Board will need to work on a  strategy to fulfill this intention.</p>
                        <p>Hudson: We aught to endorse this and incorporate County Judges  along with the County   Clerks.</p>
                        <p>Poch&eacute;:  Does the AGIO have a Draft yet?</p>
                        <p>Dalby:  The AGIO could draft up some language and share this with the Association of  Counties, Clerks and County   Judges; essentially get  the balls rolling.</p>
                        <p>Hudson: We could utilize the  attorneys at the Association of Counties to create a Draft which could then be  passed to a legislature to be brought up in session.</p>
                        <p>Bush:  We should check with the SOS to see if they are planning to do anything with  this issue</p>
                        <p>Poch&eacute;:  The SOS is swamped right now and would most likely have no problem with someone  else picking up the call and going with it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Judge Hudson motioned  to support/endorse the proposed/potential bill and to promote the working  relationships with SOS, Clerks, and Judges; with the AGIO pursuing logistics<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Russell Gibson seconded  the motion.&nbsp; No discussion, the motion  passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p>Further  discussion ensued on this topic.&nbsp; The  AGIO will report back on this subject at the next meeting of the Board.</p>
                        <p><strong>State Agencies Board  Members</strong><br />
                          This  is the year that the State Agency Board Members will term out.&nbsp; Bill Bush is willing to serve on the advisory  panel.&nbsp; Tracey Moy is affected by Act 264  which allows a person who serves a partial term to be eligible for 2 more full  terms.&nbsp; She has applied for reappointment  and Poch&eacute;/Board has supported that request.&nbsp;  Earl Smith is also eligible for one more term and he is willing to apply  for reappointment and Poch&eacute;/Board also supports his application.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>This  leaves one position open and it was requested of the attendees to the meeting  to suggest possible candidates:<br />

                            <strong>Abstract</strong>:  Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the<br />
                          type,  quality, and quantity of environmental resources. The data is used to assist<br />
                          managers  of aquatic and terrestrial resources in understanding the regional patterns<br />
                          of  the realistically attainable quality of these resources. The ecoregions were<br />
                          compiled  at a scale of 1:250,000, and depict revisions and subdivisions of earlier<br />
                          level  III ecoregions that were originally compiled at a smaller scale. It is part of  a<br />

                            <strong>Abstract</strong>:  Portfolio Conservation Areas (PCAs) are areas where The Nature<br />
                          Conservation  works toward meeting its conservation goals. The PCAs are divided<br />
                          into  terrestrial, aquatic, and karst areas with specific biodiversity conservation<br />
                          targets.  The data is intended for planning purposes such as developers, highway<br />
                          planner,  city planner, etc to avoid overlap with their projects. It is a &quot;yellow  light&quot; to<br />
                          let  planners know to proceed with caution in these areas. The data is also useful  for<br />

                          84th  General Assembly and modified by the 85th General Assembly. These were<br />
                          delineated  by using the12 digit HUCs as described by the Arkansas Natural<br />
                          Resources  Conservation Service State Office (NRCS) as the South and East borders,<br />
                          with  the state line being the North and West border. These were then classified<br />
                          using  the 8 digit numbers for management purposes. The Arkansas Natural<br />
                          resources  Commission (formerly the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation<br />
                          Commission)  developed this Title to encourage prudent practices regarding the<br />
                          application  and management of soil Nutrients and Poultry Litter to protect and<br />
                          enhance  the State's surface water quality while allowing for optimum soil fertility and<br />
                          proper  plant growth. The primary goal of this Title is to maintain the benefits<br />
                          derived  from the wise use of Poultry Litter, commercial fertilizers, and other soil<br />
                          Nutrients  while avoiding unwanted effects from excess Nutrient Applications on the<br />
                          waters  within the State. In furtherance of this goal, these Rules provide<br />
                          requirements  applicable to Nutrient Surplus Areas, Nutrient Management Plans, and<br />
                          Poultry  Litter Management Plans. These rules are designed to protect the waters<br />
                          within  the State from adverse effects of excess nutrients while allowing for<br />
                          maximum  soil fertility and proper plant growth.<br />

                          collection  of permitted dam locations in Arkansas.  Dams within the State of<br />
                          Arkansas fall  under a permit process established under Arkansas Code 15-22-201.<br />
                          All  dams with height of 25 or more feet and containing 50 acre-feet or more of<br />
                          storage  at normal pool must have a valid construction and operation permit from the<br />
                          Commission,  unless they are owned by the United States Government. If smaller<br />

                        <p>Gibson:  Are Dams part of a Homeland Security issue?</p>
                        <p>Johnson:  Dams &gt;25&rsquo; are managed by the ANRC through their Dam Safety Program.&nbsp; The ARNC does not have any concerns with  loading their data into GeoStor and the federal clearinghouse (<a href="http://www.geodata.gov/">www.geodata.gov</a> ) have several datasets that  contain dam locations. </p>
                        <p>Discussion  ensued</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Bill Bush motioned to  accept the list of geospatial data to be loaded as they become available into  GeoStor<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Yancey Reynolds seconded  the motion.&nbsp; No discussion, the motion  passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p><strong>Advisory Committee</strong></p>
                        <p>The  Advisory committee advocates, guides and attends Board meetings.&nbsp; The current Chair would like to see an  increase in involvement between the Board and their Advisory Committee.&nbsp; This will take some work as the Committee is  currently not actively meeting (defunct).&nbsp;  The Chair would like to have a joint meeting with both them and the  Board this fall and to continue to meet with the Committee at least once a year  there after.</p>
                        <p>Several  of the current committee members are no longer working in the State of Arkansas (these were  identified) Discussion ensued on who could replace these missing members:<br />
                          User  Forum: Jos Bell, CAW<br />
                          City  Government: Jeff Winter, City of Hot    Springs<br />
                          County Government:  Elizabeth Bowen, Benton;  Trina Jones, Van Buren<br />
                          Education:  EAST<br />

                        <p>It  was proposed that a new category be added to the roster &ndash; Former LIB members:  Bill Bush, Suzanne Wiley&hellip;</p>

                          Imagery for the Nation</p>
                        <p>The USGS developed a  national imagery program in the mid 90&rsquo;s. In the 2002-2003 time frame &ndash; the national  digital ortho program was created, multiple agencies participated but this went  away largely due to states taking the initiative in development of data; along  with the farm services agency. This has led toward the development of a  nationally coordinative program IMAGERY FOR THE NATION.<br />
                          Its goal is to obtain 1&rsquo;  resolution on 3 yr cycle for high population areas with option to buy up to a  higher resolution with 1m elsewhere. But there is a need for states to get  behind this program and support its initiation.</p>
                        <p>This is a positive thing for  Arkansas as  we do not have a current sustainable funding source to continue updating our  imagery.&nbsp; This program will provide this  and pay for it with federal dollars.</p>
                        <p>This is something to take  up at the next board meeting on whether we want to as a state draw up a  resolution in support of this program.</p>

                            <strong>SLIB Strategic Plan</strong><br />
                          The  Strategic Plan has been put through the NSGIC template and will be brought  forward at a future Board meeting for review.</p>
                        <p>There  is FGDC money available to help complete strategic plans and the AGIO is  willing to pursue applying for these grants.</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Judge Hudson motioned  to assign AGIO the task of applying for said grant<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Tracy Moy seconded the  motion.&nbsp; No discussion, the motion passed  unanimously.</p>
                        <p><strong>State GIS job  descriptions</strong></p>
                        <p>The  question is once again &ldquo;how to get the descriptions created for the AGIO to be  applied to all the State Agencies&rdquo;.&nbsp;  DF&amp;A is currently studying all the positions in the State (OPM  Survey) so this is out of our hands.&nbsp; It  should happen now as a matter of course in this total reclassification that DF&amp;A  is undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Discussion  ensued on the other options available for reclassification of job descriptions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Other old business</strong><br />
                          Johnson  mentioned that working groups may need to be help to determine data custodians  for the various data sets in GeoStor.</p>
                        <p>Dalby  held metadata training (2 classes) with additional classes being offered in  NWAR next week.</p>
