                        <p><strong>Agenda</strong> </p>

                          Welcomed to meeting by Chairman  Russell Gibson<strong><br clear="all" />
                          </strong>                        </p>
                        <h3>AGIO report from State Geographic  Information Coordinator </h3>
                        <p><strong><em>GeoStor</em></strong><br />
                          GeoStor  production release was January 17, 2006, there has been no negative feedback  received thus far.&nbsp; The AGIO will no  longer be submitting GeoStor usage reports to the Board.&nbsp; A new feature has been implemented that will  allow Board members, and the public, to review GeoStor usage statistics for  themselves on-line.&nbsp; A demonstration of  the statistics web-site was provided to those present.&nbsp; The URL is located at: <a href="http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/Portal/htm/output/stats.htm">http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/Portal/htm/output/stats.htm</a>.&nbsp; Discussion ensued. </p>
                        <p>The  AGIO is utilizing software known as Geocortex to monitor the service and map  log to track usage.&nbsp; Other use monitoring  is being conducted by DIS (Department of Information Systems).&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>The  AGIO is currently investigating the purchase of additional disks and blades to  be used in the support of the GeoStor system in anticipation of needing additional  space for the new aerial imagery and elevation data.</p>
                        <h3><em>Arkansas    Road</em><em> Centerline File (ACF) Grant Update</em></h3>
                        <p>The  AGIO is waiting on the Governor&rsquo;s office to make its final decision on the  grant awards to counties that applied for the ACF Grant in the first  round.&nbsp; Doug Elkins (State Executive Chief  Information Officer) and Shelby Johnson  (State Geographic Information Coordinator) met with the Governor&rsquo;s policy advisors  to brief them on the centerline program, the needs, the benefits and positive  impacts of the program.&nbsp; The advisors  asked beneficial questions regarding the applicants, and the history of the ACF  Program and concluded that meeting prepared to brief the Governor. &nbsp;Discussion ensued.</p>
                        <p>Due  to the delay in the approval of round ones applicants Shelby suggested to the  Board they might want to delay the next application deadline (currently due on  or before March 1st, 2006) to limit a situation where all 31  eligible applicants were trying to get started at the same time.&nbsp; If this happened it would create an  extraordinary amount of work for the office. </p>
                        <p><strong><em>ADOP</em></strong><br />
                          EarthData  (The ADOP Contractor) publishes an online project tracker that allows the AGIO  to follow the progression of the project all the way from flight tracking to the  final delivery of the product. &nbsp;A  demonstration of this tool and the ADOP progress was provided to Board members  present.&nbsp; The project tracker showed that  approximately 1/10th of the state had been flown as of January 18th.&nbsp;&nbsp; The demonstration also included a view of  the local buy up option showing outstanding progress made on the initial  flights of those areas in the local buy up project.&nbsp; The Communication between EarthData and  AGIO&rsquo;s Learon Dalby, the ADOP Project Manager, has been superb from day one.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>EarthData  uses an internal quality control (QC) check before releasing the product to  AGIO for our QC of the imagery.&nbsp; The AGIO  has been collecting GPS&rsquo;d control points across the state to quality check road  centerline files and these points can and will be used to QC the new orthoimagery.&nbsp; <br />
                          Discussion  ensued.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>NHD  Training</em></strong><br />
                        The  AGIO and the USGS have joined together to provide free National Hydrography  Dataset (NHD - a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that contains  information about surface water features) training in the State of Arkansas.&nbsp; There have been over 80 applicants for the  course and it has been determined that several training sessions will be held  in both Central and Northwest Arkansas to  accommodate the locations of the applicants.&nbsp;  The site for the Central Arkansas sessions will be held at the Arkansas  Department of Environmental Quality&rsquo;s (ADEQ) training facilities and the Northwest Arkansas site has yet to be determined as of  this meeting. </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Discuss long-range sustainable funding  for counties and cities to assist with continuous creation and maintenance of  usable local-level data.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>There is always a challenge  in obtaining funding for local-level data.&nbsp;  Not only to identify funding sources but to keep up the momentum for the  development of data.&nbsp; The most critical  data layers at this time are Roads, City Boundaries, and Cadastral. </p>
                        <p>In the 2003 session there  was a proposed bill that included a fee that would be turned back to pay for  the development of cadastral data (parcels).&nbsp;  But, the bill was not well received at the time because the revenue was  split between the AGIO and the counties developing the data.&nbsp; At that time the AGIO did not have sustainable  funding to support its operation.&nbsp; Through  the leadership of the Governor, the Legislature and the Executive Chief  Information Officer that issue has since been resolved by General Revenue  funding for the Office.&nbsp; The Board might now  want to consider supporting a bill that would generate revenue that could be  entirely directed to the counties for development and maintenance of local  framework data such as centerlines, cadastral, administrative boundaries,  floodplains, and higher resolution orthoimagery. </p>
                        <p>Other states handle this  issue by placing a fee on wireless 911 (VI, UT, WV, &hellip;) or placing a fee on to real  estate transfers (MT &amp; WI) that is used to develop and maintain data.&nbsp; In TN the General Assembly of the state  carved out a set amount of money from general revenue to support GIS  development across the state.&nbsp; Extensive  discussion ensued with the conclusion that it is the Board&rsquo;s responsibility to  continue to study and address this situation.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Discussion and vote to approve loading  of new data into GeoStor2.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The Board&rsquo;s Policy on  loading data into GeoStor was passed out to members present for their review.&nbsp; Following the policy the AGIO prepared a  recommendation for the following layers to be loaded into GeoStor.</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>Ortho imagery from Crawford       County, Poinsett       County, the City of Hope, and the City of Arkadelphia</li>
                          <li>FEMA&rsquo;s Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRMs)       both City and County level</li>
                          <li>8-Digit level High Resolution NHD Hydro Data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Since there is not a Quorum  present at the meeting the vote for approval was tabled until the next meeting. </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Discuss the Board&rsquo;s potential role in  law revision(s) regarding city boundary changes.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>This issue was recognized  during the recent merging of the cities previously known as Helena  and West Helena in to one city now known as  Helena-West Helena.&nbsp; There are several different  ways that a city can change its boundaries and not all of them require the same  reporting procedures.&nbsp; Shelby suggested that in order to track the  changes in municipal boundaries that all boundary changes be reported in the  same manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will synchronize all of the modifications  and help create and maintain an updated boundary for the community at both the  local and the state levels.&nbsp; Discussion  ensued.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Gibson requested  that the AGIO study the legislation surrounding municipal boundary changes and  report back to the Board.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Strategic Planning and discussion of  future goals and objectives for the SLIB.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Guest Suzanne Wiley  presiding.&nbsp; The Strategic Plan was  reviewed and edited for content.&nbsp; The  newest version will be distributed to all of the Board members for their  consideration prior to the next meeting.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Future meeting dates</em></strong><br />
                          Wednesday, March 22nd,  2006 9:30am &ndash; 4:00pm<br />
