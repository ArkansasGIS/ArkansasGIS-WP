                        <p><strong>AGIO report from State Geographic Information  Coordinator (issued by Learon Dalby)</strong><br />
                            <strong><em>GeoStor  Status Update</em></strong><br />
                            <strong>Challenges </strong><br />
                          The  geographic search is producing false positives for available data.&nbsp; Due to a geographic extent in the metadata  search GeoStor will report that data is available when in fact the data is not  a continuous statewide dataset.&nbsp;&nbsp; This  causes GeoStor to respond with a &ldquo;no features found&rdquo; message.&nbsp; We are aware of this issue and we are working  to resolve this issue.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>AGIO  has disabled the raster re-projection option in GeoStor and is delivering  rasters in the same projection they were loaded into GeoStor (native projection).&nbsp; Safe software, producer of Spatial Direct  &amp; Feature Manipulation Engine &ndash; the software used to extract and re-project  data in to the format and coordinate system of their choice - is working to resolve  this issue.&nbsp; Spatial Direct can perform  raster re-projection but the algorithm used is <strong>very</strong> slow. &nbsp;No large amount  of negative feedback has been received. Safe anticipates the issue being  resolved by mid summer. AGIO staff will implement the solution as soon as it is  provided.</p>
                        <p><strong>Successes</strong><br />
                          AGIO  has been working toward encouraging data custodians to load and maintain their  own data in GeoStor. &nbsp;Arkansas Department  of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) has made a request to do this with their Non-Point  Source Pollution (NPSP) data.&nbsp; They are  also interested in building a Web Mapping Application that would run off of the  GeoStor System.&nbsp; ADEQ would be  responsible for building the application. AGIO staff would only be responsible  for &lsquo;prepping&rsquo; the system.</p>
                        <p>The  AGIO also has plans to create a web map application to serve up FEMA&rsquo;s new  DFIRMs for use by the states Floodplain Administrators that will run from the  GeoStor system. </p>
                        <p>There  has been an increase in interest in Fayetteville  shale, gas and oil locations in Arkansas.&nbsp; There have been several requests for the AGIO  to revise the current Oil &amp; Gas Commission statewide web application to  focus on this and release it to the public.</p>
                        <p>GeoStor  Use Statistics - the Board was shown the use statistics link on the GeoStor  website. &nbsp;On February 10th, an  article was released in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette newspaper about the ADOP  program and the use of the map viewer greatly increased for about 4 days. &nbsp;Due to increased usage and the desire of the  public to view Ortho Imagery, small changes were made to the map viewer to make  accessing the orthos easier.&nbsp; There is  also information about the most popular layers being viewed and  downloaded.&nbsp; The AGIO is still working  toward encouraging users to make a direct connection to GeoStor through and IMS  connection as opposed to downloads.&nbsp; There  is currently no ability to track feature service requests, but we are working  with a software monitoring company called Latitude Graphics to figure this out.</p>
                        <h3><em>Arkansas    Road</em><em> Centerline File (ACF) Grant Update</em></h3>
                        <p>The  Governor has released funds for the ACF Grant, and the counties that are receiving  the Centerline Grants (Round 1) were presented a notice of award at the County  Judges Winter Meeting last week.&nbsp; The Round  2 submissions are due by March 31st.&nbsp;  Shelby and Kimberly visited with 10 of the 18 counties eligible for  Round 2 at the County Judges Meeting to make them aware of the opportunity.&nbsp; Several counties from Round 1 are already moving  forward with their projects.&nbsp; Vince and  Kimberly are arranging Kick-off meetings for counties that received grants to  discuss the Project expectations and schedule.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>ADOP</em></strong><br />
                          The  Project status graphic was shown to the Board and only approximately 7 flight  lines in north east Arkansas and 5 lines over Polk County  need re-flying to complete the project. Earth Data is still maintaining two planes  in or near the state to complete the project.&nbsp;  The deliverable products are 1m Color InfraRed (CIR), 1m True color, 5m  Digital Elevation Model (DEM), 5m 1st return elevation data, five  areas of 1&rsquo; imagery &ndash;Garland, Miller, Saline, Sebastian, and Pulaski Counties  and all the associated raw data. The AGIO anticipates a public release of data in  February or March of 2007.</p>
                        <p>The  AGIO is also working to make the data available through Microsoft Virtual Earth  and Google earth with credit source being the State of Arkansas.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>NHD  Training</em></strong><br />
                          The  AGIO and the USGS have joined together to provide free National Hydrography  Dataset (NHD - a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that contains  information about surface water features) training in the State of Arkansas.&nbsp; There have been over 80 applicants for the  course and it has been determined that several training sessions will be held  in both Central and Northwest Arkansas to  accommodate the locations of the applicants.&nbsp;  The site for the Central Arkansas sessions will be held at the Arkansas  Department of Environmental Quality&rsquo;s (ADEQ) training facilities and the Northwest Arkansas site has yet to be determined as of  this meeting. </p>
                        <p>The  classes have begun to be scheduled for the month of March and the attendees are  being notified by email of the dates and times of their class.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Discussion and vote to approve loading  of new data into GeoStor2.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The Board&rsquo;s Policy on  loading data into GeoStor was passed out to members present for their  review.&nbsp; Following the policy the AGIO  prepared a recommendation for the following layers to be loaded into GeoStor.</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>Ortho imagery from Crawford       County, Poinsett       County, the City of Hope, and the City of Arkadelphia</li>
                          <li>FEMA&rsquo;s Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps       (DFIRMs) both City and County level</li>
                          <li>8-Digit level High Resolution NHD Hydro Data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Bill Bush made a motion to approve the loading of the layers listed above.<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Brian Culpepper seconded the motion as proxy for Dr. Fred Limp. No discussion,  the motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p>Learon Dalby passed out the  Policy Statement for GeoStor Data Loading Procedures and the GeoStor Data Loading  Guidelines to bring to the Board&rsquo;s attention the changes recommended to the  Procedures and Guidelines.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recommended changes for the Policy Statement</strong> </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The new state  guidelines are for data to be created and maintained in NAD83 and not  NAD27.&nbsp; The policy has been revised to  illustrate this difference. </li>
                          <li>On page 5,  concerning security concerns, a line item has been added that links to the FGDC  security guidelines</li>
                          <li>On page 3  section 6.0, where data submitters fill out information about their data, the  AGIO feels that would be better if it was a web form that could be filled in  online.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Recommended changes for the Data loading guidelines</strong> </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Update the  Guidelines to reflect the changes to the Policy Statement</li>
                          <li>References to Sun  and Linux were removed</li>
                          <li>Accepting data  on outdated media types such as 8mm tapes were removed and added the ability to  accept data provided on portable hard drives was added</li>
                          <li>Field names that  are unique to other systems and therefore cannot be used in data layers are  listed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These changes will need a  motion and were tabled until the next board meeting.&nbsp; Copies of these two documents will be sent  out to absent board members for review.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Discussion about moving the meetings to  a quarterly schedule.</em></strong></p>
                        <p>In the past, the Board has  tried to meet monthly or even every other month with additional meetings during  a legislative session.&nbsp; But, as the Board  is stabilizing it may make more sense to meet quarterly.&nbsp; If an urgent issue comes up the Board can  meet via teleconference.&nbsp; All of the  Board members will be polled via email to get their opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>This issue was tabled until  the April meeting to allow the Board to review the change.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Board Member Travel Reimbursement.</em></strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Motion: </strong>Bill  Bush made a motion to authorize travel expenses to be paid to board members for  the calendar year of 2006<br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Phyllis  Poch&eacute; seconded the motion. No discussion, the motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p>A travel packet was handed  out that will allow the AGIO to obtain needed information for  reimbursement.&nbsp; These will be mailed to  absent Board members.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
                        <p><strong><em>Future meeting dates</em></strong><br />
                          Looking at Mid-April &ndash; full  day<br />
                          Held at the Offices of the  AGIO<br />
                          Board member will poll via  email to determine the next available date for a meeting.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Comments from guests</em></strong><br />
                          None</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Bill Bush made a motion to adjourn the meeting <br />
                            <strong>Second:</strong> Bob Stanley seconded the motion.&nbsp; No  discussion, the motion passed unanimously.<br />
