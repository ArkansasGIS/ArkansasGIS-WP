                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          17th Floor Conference Room, Union Building, in Little 
                          Rock. Minutes from the last meeting of December 9, 1999 
                          meeting were unanimously approved. </p>
                        <h3>Reports</h3>
                        <p><em><strong>Report 
                          from the State Land Information Coordinator </strong></em></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reported that the Request for Bids announcement 
                          for the CIR project were finalized on December 9, 1999.
                          He gave a long presentation on December 15 to 
                          the Electronic Records Study Commission regarding how 
                          GIS is affected by the electronic records issue, and 
                          there was a lot of discussion about county offices and 
                          databases at the county level. He highlighted for them how important their decision 
                          making will be and how it will affect GIS. Shelby described how he tried to impress the ERSC with the 
                          costly nature of GIS systems as a counterpoint to the 
                          popular idea that records should be free for public 
                          access and hoped that they would weight their decisions 
                          carefully. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby also met with the Arkansas Highway and Transportation 
                          Department to work toward coordination on a county pilot 
                          project with Baxter County to exchange data. This will be highlighted at a future meeting 
                          with the county judges. </p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that he has hired a student intern 
                          and that she will be working on the GIS audit project. He is looking to run the audit internally instead 
                          of seeking outside sources. The audit will be sent to everyone in Arkansas 
                          that has anything to do with land management, both public 
                          and private, and he plans to have the survey accessible 
                          for on-line submission. He explained that his intern is also working 
                          on the state profile for FGDC and NSGIC. </p>
                        <p>Another activity that he is working on is the technology 
                          mapping project which involves collecting government 
                          locations and the structure of the fiber network across 
                          the state. He 
                          has worked with the Department of Health assisting them 
                          in looking at how the DOH utilizes GIS and how they 
                          can utilize it better. </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Color 
                          Infrared Photography Project</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Shelby next spoke regarding the funding effort for 
                          the CIR project. He explained that he had met with the Arkansas 
                          Municipal League and that they are now supporting the 
                          effort. The 
                          Municipal League will use their magazine and communications 
                          resources to advertise this project with their member 
                          cities. He 
                          also met with the Arkansas Electric Cooperatives and 
                          they are very supportive of the project. Another meeting was held with key executives 
                          at the Arkansas Farm Bureau and he feels that their 
                          support is forthcoming. </p>
                        <p>Last week Shelby met with Arkansas One Call and he 
                          encouraged the LIB to foster a relationship with them 
                          as an organization who is very concerned with the mission 
                          of the Board. He explained that they have a lot of resources 
                          at stake and are very interested in the project. Shelby pointed out that Arkansas One Call represents 
                          over 330 member utilities in the state and that they 
                          all stand to benefit from the success of the LIB in 
                          the CIR project. </p>
                        <p>Shelby went on to describe that the Governor's Office 
                          has directed the LIB to work with the Department of 
                          Economic Development and also to seek out, with their 
                          guidance, the Economic Development Fund Commission funding. Since the last meeting, he had met with the chair 
                          of that commission, Jim Pledger. Shelby gave him an outline of what the Board 
                          is about and what the Board was trying to do, the D 
                          I S role, and asked Mr. Pledger whether the CIR project 
                          was a viable project for funding by their group. He told Shelby to bring it before the Commission for consideration. Shelby also explained that the Department of 
                          Economic Development will assist the Board in preparing 
                          the proposal to take before the Fund Commission. He explained that the Economic Development Fund Commission 
                          will meet on March 20, which gives about one month to 
                          get some additional fund support on the grant application 
                          to the Commission. He has upcoming meetings with the Forestry Association Board, 
                          all the county judges, some representatives at the federal 
                          level at the Digital Delta Conference, and the Arkansas 
                          Flood Plain Managers Association. Shelby will be meeting in Denver at the Geographic 
                          Information Technology Association where he will give 
                          a presentation about the technology mapping project.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Delta Project </em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley next spoke about the President Clinton's 
                          memo on December 10 to the heads of many government 
                          agencies regarding the Arkansas Delta Circuit Rider 
                          Pilot Project, similar to the large Delta Project but 
                          just for Arkansas. He is expanding his administration's efforts 
                          in Arkansas Delta communities by creating this program 
                          to provide a concentrated, coordinated effort by 14 
                          federal agencies to address needs in areas such as housing, 
                          economic development, transportation, tourism, environment, 
                          cultural resources, infrastructure, technology, education, 
                          and health care. President Clinton has directed agencies to coordinate 
                          their efforts by March 1, 2000. </p>
                        <p>Ray Fox from the USGS has approached the Board regarding 
                          GIS data for Arkansas that the participating agencies 
                          will need by March 1. He has indicated that the USGS will put additional staff on 
                          to help with the QAQC for the CIR project and that there 
                          is a good chance for some funding. Suzanne said that the draft IP from the vendor 
                          will be sent to Ray and he has offered to do some editing 
                          and corrections to get it in order. </p>
                        <p>The CIR vendor, Pixxures, has indicated that the FSA, 
                          USFS, USGS, the Corps of Engineers, and other large 
                          agencies are very interested in type of project in regards 
                          to the whole United States, and that if that goes through 
                          it will reduce the cost for Arkansas data substantially. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Old Business</h3>
                        <p><em><strong>Advisory Council/Steering Committee</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley brought up the subject again of developing 
                          a steering committee for the LIB. This type of committee would help provide input 
                          and legislative support for efforts and would also provide 
                          a way for the Board to interact with agencies and groups 
                          around the state in a formal manner. She recommended that a committee be organized 
                          before the next legislative session. </p>
                        <p>Randy Jones asked if the Board could issue a letter 
                          of appreciation to Michael Hipp regarding Shelby Johnson's 
                          hard work and excellent results in his pursuit of various 
                          GIS projects.Suzanne Wiley agreed to write a letter to that 
                          effect.                        </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Committees</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley pointed out that the Board committees 
                          need to continue in their efforts. She praised the efforts of Darla Chappell, Shelby's 
                          intern, regarding her work on compiling a database for 
                          the GIS audit and inventory project. Suzanne explained that strategic plan is still 
                          a high priority and that the Board needs continue work 
                          on that effort. </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Year-End Report</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush said that he completed the LIB year-end report 
                          and filed it prior to the deadline. </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Financial Reports</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne reminded the members that their financial report 
                          needed to be filed with the Secretary of State's Office 
                          by January 31, 2000. </p>
                        <h3><b>New Business</b></h3>
                        <p><em><strong>Board Member Expiration Dates</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that she was made aware that 
                          all the members' appointment dates expire at the same 
                          time in 2001. She checked on this and learned that the legislation 
                          which created the board set up all terms to expire on 
                          the same date. Susan Cromwell explained that Act 914, which 
                          created the Board, will most likely have changes proposed 
                          in the next legislative session. Susan said that it would be a good time to propose 
                          changes to the members' terms of service in order to 
                          stagger the expiration dates to provide continuity within 
                          the Board.                        </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Action Items</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley listed the following action items that 
                          need attention over the next six months: </p>
                        <ul>
                         <li> 
                            <p>CIR project/Delta Project </p>
                          </li>
						  <li> 
                            <p>Legislation plans </p>
                          </li>
						  <li> 
                            <p>Progress from the LIB subcommittees </p>
                          </li>
						  <li> 
                            <p>Follow legislation being developed by state surveyors 
                              prevent conflicts </p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>She added that the MidAmerica GIS Conference will be held 
                          in Missouri in May. She pointed out that it would be a good thing 
                          for the Board to be a co-sponsor, which would include 
                          the registration of a participant and booth space. It is a regional meeting and she said it would 
                          be a good way to promote the Board and its work. </p>
                        <h3>Next Meeting</h3>
                        <p>The next meeting was proposed to fall on the same day 
                          as the next Nortel training session, which will be announced.
                          The March meeting will fall during the period 
                          of March 19-22, 2000, to coincide with the meeting of 
                          the ACSM meeting in Little Rock, to allow the members 
                          to participate in the conference. The date and location will be announced. </p>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned. </p>
                        <p></p>
