                      <p><strong>Agenda</strong><br />
                        The meeting was called to order by Chair Poch&eacute; at 10:05AM. </p>
                      <p>Board members and guests were welcomed to meeting  by the Chair.&nbsp; The minutes of the June  11, 2008 meeting were distributed electronically to members prior to the  meeting.&nbsp; The Chair requested a motion  for approval of the minutes.</p>
                      <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Judge Clayton Castleman motioned approval of the  minutes, as distributed<br />
                        <strong>Second:</strong> Kasey Summerville seconded the motion.&nbsp; There being no discussion, the motion passed  unanimously.</p>
                      <p><strong>New Business</strong><br />
                        Develop Board's Position on State Participation in  the USDA Farm Services Agency National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).</p>
                      <p>Shelby introduced the issue facing the Board. He  began by discussing the importance of imagery and remarked the digital ortho  imagery of the state has been the number one downloaded data product and  service of the Board through GeoStor since 2005.&nbsp; He stated the 2006 imagery had been  distributed to every County E9-1-1 and every Assessor Office in the state. He  then provided an overview of an Issue Paper prepared for the Board attached as Exhibit 1 Page 4.&nbsp; Following the overview of the issue Shelby  closed by asking the Board if there were any questions?</p>
                      <p>Bruce Gorham, a remote sensing specialist, from the  Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies provided a summary of the advantages  and disadvantages of leaf on versus leaf off imagery.</p>
                      <p>Bekki White commented that for geological mapping  they prefer leaf off imagery but must consider the greater needs of the state.</p>
                      <p>Randy Everett commented about the desire of leaf  off for utility mapping but wanted to bear in mind the needs of the state to  update the data. </p>
                      <p>Phyllis Poche echoed the comments of White and Everett  about the importance of meeting the needs for the greatest number of imagery  users in the state.</p>
                      <p>Tracy Moy requested if the AGIO were aware of any  other parties that were interested in acquiring leaf on data?&nbsp; Shelby responded that AGIO was not aware of  any users requesting leaf on data.&nbsp; But  he did comment that users were interested in receiving updated data.&nbsp; In particular he referenced the County  Assessor Offices and that several counties had asked when new imagery would be  acquired.</p>
                      <p>Kasey Summerville stated that for County  reappraisals the Assessors need leaf off imagery to see new construction and  she worried that in the forested areas of the state any new construction would  be difficult to see.</p>
                      <p>Glen Dabney offered that in his experience as a Forester  and working in the forest industry that nearly all forest applications required  imagery to be leaf off because it provided the best distinction between  hardwood and softwood.</p>
                      <p>Judge Clayton Castleman offered the perspective of  county governments needing to see roads and other infrastructure and the state  needed to move forward.</p>
                      <p>Dr Kissell provided input saying the leaf off would  be favored compared to leaf on.</p>
                      <p>Earl Smith stated there appears to be a strong case  for leaf off imagery with but could support a leaf on mission given the  partnership funding opportunity that USDA was providing.&nbsp; Earl commented the important issue was  whether or not state agencies could provide partnership funding to cover the  entire state under their current budget and the timing was not good. Agencies  would have to commit surplus funds ahead of the time they would know what if  any surplus might exist.</p>
                      <p>Earl Smith suggested if there were agencies and  private cooperators that could support FSA they should be encouraged to do so.</p>
                      <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Robert Kissell motioned that AGIO pursue leaf off mission  as in the past and be aware of future missions for leaf on partnerships.<br />
                        <strong>Second:</strong> Randy Everett seconded motion.&nbsp; There being no further discussion the Chair  called the question and the motion passed unanimously.</p>
                      <p><strong>Adjourn</strong><br />
                        <strong>Motion:</strong> Bekki White motioned  to adjourn the meeting.<br />
                        <strong>Second:</strong> Kasey Summerville  seconded the motion.&nbsp; There being no further discussion the Chair called the question and the  meeting adjourned at  11:00 am</p>

                      <div>
                        <p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
                      </div>
                      <p>In  summer of 2009 the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Services Agency (FSA)  will produce digital orthoimagery covering 90% of the state of Arkansas.&nbsp; This data will be flown under the National  Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).&nbsp; The  state can partner to cover the remainder.&nbsp;  This would update the state&rsquo;s digital orthophotography database at  dramatically lower cost to the state.&nbsp;  The data is used as a base map layer for a multitude of  applications.&nbsp; Digital orthophotography  is a fundamental map layer for the state&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS)  and is defined as a framework data layer in the law creating the State Land  Information Board.</p>
                      <p>The  four band product available through this program is identical to imagery  procured through the state program with the exception of one major difference.&nbsp; The FSA requires leaf on flight missions.  This paper discusses issues associated with participating in the FSA project.  This approach would require a change from prior state specifications of leaf  off (winter missions).&nbsp; This change has  serious consequences for users needing to locate infrastructure and real estate  improvements.</p>
                      <p>The  AGIO requests the State Land Information Board provide guidance and set the  state&rsquo;s strategic direction regarding this issue.</p>
                      <p>Background of the  NAIP Program<br />
                        NAIP  is a program to acquire peak growing season &ldquo;leaf on&rdquo; imagery, and deliver this  imagery to USDA County Service Centers, in order to maintain the common land  unit (CLU) boundaries and assist with farm programs.&nbsp; In 2006 the program was fully funded and  through efforts by FSA they were able to acquire statewide coverage of Arkansas  at two meter resolution.&nbsp; The compressed  county mosaics (CCMs) of this data were provided to the state and the data was  made available via the GeoStor FTP site.<br />
  <a href="ftp://ftp.geostor.arkansas.gov/geostor_raster_01/NAIP_2006/">ftp://ftp.geostor.arkansas.gov/geostor_raster_01/NAIP_2006/</a> </p>
                      <p>The  goal of NAIP is to collect 1 meter imagery for the entire conterminous United  States. The imagery is either natural color or &ldquo;four band&rdquo; imagery, and is  delivered in the year of acquisition.&nbsp;  FSA has a goal to begin collecting this data on a three year cycle with  the first being 2009 and then 2012.&nbsp; The  data will be collected during leaf on conditions.&nbsp; The program is not fully funded for 2009 and  therefore will ONLY produce imagery  for 90% of the state of Arkansas that contains CLU locations.&nbsp; Although the entire state will be flown, the  areas without CLUs will not be processed.&nbsp;  The State can partner with FSA to produce the remaining areas within the  contract.&nbsp; FSA will manage the contract,  conduct initial quality control and swiftly provide all the deliverables to the  state.&nbsp; The data is considered public  domain and therefore could be distributed to Land Information Board  constituents.</p>
                      <p><strong>Background of the  State Program</strong><br />
                        The  Arkansas Digital Ortho Program (ADOP) is a state based effort to procure  statewide digital orthophotography for the people of Arkansas and deliver this  product via the state&rsquo;s GIS data clearinghouse.&nbsp;  This program was the first major effort instituted by the Board.&nbsp; In 2001 a statewide leaf off mission was  launched and completed.&nbsp; The project  received the majority of funding from the Economic Development Fund of  Arkansas, and cooperative funding from federal, state, local and private  partners.&nbsp; The data was updated again in  2006 as a leaf off product.&nbsp; The second  update received a General Improvement Fund appropriation by the legislature and  was funded from the Governor&rsquo;s portion.&nbsp;  The second project specification was changed to require a digital sensor  to acquire both natural color and color infrared.&nbsp; This product has been the number one product  downloaded from GeoStor since the inception of the system. AGIO has delivered  this data to every County Assessor and County E9-1-1 office in the state.&nbsp; The ADOP data has become the back bone of the  County Assessor Mapping Program and the Arkansas Centerline File Program.</p>
                      <p>AGIO  placed a request in its biennial budget to update the ADOP data again with a  proposed mission launch in winter 2010.&nbsp;  At this time the likelihood of funding for this request is unknown.</p>
                      <p><strong>State GIS  Clearinghouse Usage</strong> <br />
                        Table 1 shows a comparison of the number of  downloads by county for ADOP leaf off versus NAIP leaf on since 2006 from the  GeoStor file download site.&nbsp; These  numbers do not reflect requests individually processed through GeoStor. These  numbers do not do reflect any usage numbers reported from FSA.<br />
                        Table 1</p>
                      <p><img src="../../../Images/Graphics/Imagery_Downloads.JPG" width="400" height="250" /></p>
                      <p>NAIP  Leaf On Downloads&nbsp; - 5,751<br />
                        ADOP  Leaf Off County Mosaics RGB Downloads &ndash; 27,109</p>
                      <p><strong>Issues for Consideration</strong><br />
                        The  proposed 2009 NAIP four band product is virtually identical to current state  products with the exception of the leaf on requirement.</p>
                      <p>The  2009 NAIP found band product would be 1 meter resolution, natural color and  color infrared, tiled by USGS quarter quads. (Same as the 2006 Arkansas  product.)</p>
                      <p>A  decision to partner with FSA must be made before December 31st, 2008.</p>
                      <p>FSA  would hold the contract, manage the project and deliver the product.</p>
                      <p>FSA  requires a single state point of contact for project cooperators.</p>
                      <p>The  mission would be flown in June and July of 2009 with product delivery beginning  after 60 days as areas are acquired and processed.</p>
                      <p>Arkansas&rsquo;  estimated cost share to partner with FSA is $120,002 on the four band  product.&nbsp; AGIO believes the four band  product is a superior product.</p>
                      <p>Arkansas&rsquo;  estimated cost share to partner with FSA is $76,562 on the film product.</p>
                      <p>At  this time AGIO does not have funding to fulfill the state&rsquo;s estimated  cost.&nbsp; If directed by the Board AGIO  could act as the single point of contact for the state.&nbsp; AGIO could identify and coordinate with  potential state cooperators for funding. </p>
                      <p>If  the state does not participate FSA will produce the data for the quarter quads  for their use where it overlaps their Common Land Units (farm fields).&nbsp; This is roughly 90% of the state.</p>
                      <p>Areas  of the state that lack Common Land Unit locations are primarily in the upland  areas of the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests where there are no farm  fields.</p>
                      <p>If  the state does not participate FSA will create a compressed county mosaic for  each county and would share that with the state after the project has ended.</p>
                      <p>Leaf  on imagery is ideally suited to monitor crops, crop types, crop health, timber  types, timber stands, biomass and other applications.&nbsp; Man made features under tree canopy are not  visible and therefore cannot be mapped.</p>
                      <p>Leaf  off imagery is ideally suited for base mapping activities where the imagery  serves as a visual reference to digitize features and structures.</p>
                      <p>Leaf  off is better suited for mapping smaller streams in the upland areas of the  state.</p>

                      <p>Minimum partnership  contribution  refers to the minimum cost share amount required from State and local funding  and does not guarantee full state coverage.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
                        Full State  partnership contribution refers to the amount needed to complete full State  coverage. The optimum situation would be for Federal partnerships at the  National level to cover this amount, independent of State partnership  contribution. However, to guarantee full State coverage, State partner  consortiums can fund this amount. </p>
                      <p>**  The Minimum Cost share amount is enough to complete full state coverage. This  occurs in smaller states and in states with a high percentage of agricultural  land, as defined by USDA Farm Service Agency</p>
