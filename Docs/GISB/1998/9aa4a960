                        <p><strong>Attending Members<br />
                          </strong>Mr. William Bush, Arkansas Geological Commission<br />
                          Ms. Susan Cromwell, Office of Information Technology<br />
                          Mr. Shelby Johnson, CAST<br />

                        <p><strong>Members Unable to Attend<br />
                          </strong>Dr. Robert Bennett, Arkansas State University 
                          <br />
                          Ms. Cathie Matthews / Mr. Cecil Davis, Alternate, Dept. 
                          of Arkansas Heritage<br />
                          Mr. Randy Jones, First Electric Corporation<br />
                          Mr. Ben Kittler, Kittler Surveying<br />
                          Mr. Phil Schoettlin, Chamber of Commerce, Fayetteville<br />
                          Mr. Jim Wells, Wellsco Graphics Solution Center</p>
                        <p><strong>Guests<br />
                          </strong>Jelyn Thomas, Arkansas Highway Department<br />
                          Scott Sutterfield, Arkansas Historic Preservation Program</p>
                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order and roll was called.</p>
                        <p><b>Land Information Coordinator</b></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush opened the meeting by asking Susan Cromwell 
                          to bring the Board up to date on the status of the State 
                          Land Information Coordinator position.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell said that the interview process the 
                          Department of Information Systems uses requires a standardized 
                          set of questions to be used for each applicant, and 
                          she asked the Board members for input regarding any 
                          special skills questions that would be needed. Susan 
                          also asked whether the Board would like to form a subcommittee 
                          to assist specifically in the interview process for 
                          this position. She explained that she would like at 
                          least one Board member to be on the interview team, 
                          which would consist of herself, another DIS person (probably 
                          Clarence Durand). Sixteen applications have been received 
                          and she asked for assistance in screening these applications. 
                          Susan asked that Bill Bush communicate with the members 
                          by Email and choose a representative to sit in on the 
                          interviews. Bill also suggested that if the screening 
                          process turns up two or three evenly matched applicants, 
                          DIS may want the Board's feedback on those applicants. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell explained that it will be possible to 
                          extend the application period if no qualified applicant 
                          is found this time around. Shelby Johnson recommended 
                          that the applicants might be required to provide a portfolio 
                          of project work. Bill Bush agreed that it would be good 
                          to see a sample of the applicants' writing abilities. 
                          Susan also explained that it is not the State's practice 
                          to pay for travel expenses, and Bill Bush recommended 
                          a phone interview process to cull the applicants. The 
                          suggestion was made that it also might be possible to 
                          do a video interview if the applicant had access to 
                          a video site.</p>
                        <p><b>Annual Report and Mission Statement</b></p>
                        <p> Bill Bush said that he will draw up an annual report 
                          for review, which will be drawn from the year's minutes. 
                          He explained that the report would have to be approved 
                          by a quorum of the members and then filed by the end 
                          of December. Bill also pointed out that if the annual 
                          report and mission statement are not filed, that the 
                          Board would be unable to present any legislation during 
                          the next session. </p>
                        <p><b>Attendance</b></p>
                        <p> The members discussed the need to come up with some 
                          recommendations as to potential Board appointees to 
                          forward to the Governor's Office. Bill Bush explained 
                          that the Board now consists of three state representatives, 
                          three city/county representatives, two private sector 
                          representatives, and three academic representatives. 
                          In the previous meeting, nominees had been suggested 
                          from the city/county sector, but that the Board actually 
                          needed a nominee from the private sector. Bill did say 
                          that the city/county nominee list would probably be 
                          usable in the future, as several members have missed 
                          three meetings in a row and he had had to send their 
                          names to the Governor's Office. The Governor's 
                          Office will contact them and then the members have 20 
                          days to respond regarding their attendance. If they 
                          have good reasons for being unable to attend the meetings, 
                          then they will remain on the Board.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell strongly recommended that a representative 
                          from the telecommunications industry or utility industries 
                          would be very valuable to the Board. Several suggestions 
                          were made, which included Entergy, Alltel, and Southwestern 
                          Bell. The members agreed that they would all search 
                          their contacts with private industry to try and locate 
                          possible nominees for the Board. Bill Bush asked that 
                          if anyone came up with a name, to let him know and he'd 
                          forward the recommendation to the Governor's Office.</p>
                        <p><b>Legislative Issues</b></p>
                        <p> Bill Bush explained that he had found out that the 
                          Joint Committee on Advanced Communications and Information 
                          Technology was not scheduled to meet again for the rest 
                          of the year. Shelby Johnson explained that he had conversed 
                          with Michael Hipp of DIS and was informed that any legislation 
                          the Board initiates does not require approval by the 
                          Joint Committee, just review. Bill Bush explained that 
                          since the Board couldn't ask the Committee to meet, 
                          the Board could submit reports for distribution anyway 
                          and assume that if there was a problem with the report, 
                          the Committee would contact the Board. He said that 
                          is what the Board will do with the strategic plan. It 
                          will be submitted to the Joint Committee and to Michael 
                          Hipp, and whatever else is in the legislation, and then 
                          submit a copy to the Legislative Council and ask them 
                          to mail it out to the members. Bill Bush explained that 
                          the Board could comply simply by submitting the reports 
                          and by making sure that any proposed legislation be 
                          submitted to the chairman and all committee members.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell explained that the Board will not really 
                          have any legislation. The Board will have legislation 
                          for which it will find a sponsor, and that sponsor will 
                          have legislation. She said that there are key individuals 
                          who can meet with the Board and help prepare and seek 
                          sponsorship. Susan recommended that Senator Gordon on 
                          the Joint Committee would be a very good place to start. 
                          The members agreed that researching the new legislators 
                          would be valuable in order to find out which ones would 
                          support technology initiatives.</p>
                        <p>Bill Bush pointed out that it is very important to 
                          track legislation through the process and someone will 
                          need to keep up with this.</p>
                        <p><b>Geodetic Advisor</b></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush reminded the Board that he had sent out a 
                          questionnaire to all the Geodetic Advisors in the country 
                          and that he has been getting some responses. He said 
                          that he will make copies for the Board members once 
                          he has most of them back. He commented that most of 
                          the responses at this point had been very positive. 
                          Some of the questions he asked were: 
                        </p><ul>
                          <li> 
                            <p>How much money does your state put into the program?</p>
                          </li>
                          <li> 
                            <p>What do they provide in the way of equipment or 
                              staff?</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>He was surprised to find out that they didn't 
                          really have any staff, but that they were there primarily 
                          to educate and to train in most of the states. He said 
                          it looked like it was costing a state between $150,000 
                          and $200,000 a year to support a Geodetic Advisor program, 
                          with what is required as far as overhead, office space, 
                          part of the salary and benefits, and other expenses. 
                          He felt that there is enough information coming in for 
                          the Board to get a handle on what was needed for the 
                          same type of program in Arkansas. </p>
                        <p><b>Legislative Strategy</b></p>
                        <p><b><i>Guest: Julie Cullen, Deputy Director of DIS</i></b></p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell introduced Julie Cullen, who was invited 
                          to talk to the Board regarding legislative strategies 
                          for the upcoming legislative session in 1999. Julie 
                          explained that she is the Deputy Director of the Department 
                          of Information Systems and she reports to Michael Hipp. 
                          She explained that she met with him prior to this meeting 
                          to talk about what role DIS would play in any legislation 
                          that the Board proposes.</p>
                        <p>Julie began by explaining that the dynamics of this 
                          legislative session would be very different in that 
                          there are at least 50 new members in the House and around 
                          14 new senators. Republicans have gained two seats the 
                          split in the House is 28 seats, and they lost one seat 
                          in the Senate. She explained that as far legislators 
                          with interested in information technology issues, in 
                          the Senate there is Senator Gordon and Senator Malone, 
                          and in the House is Representative Magnus and Representative 
                          Percy Malone. The firs thing she advised the Board to 
                          do is to find a sponsor for any bills. Prefiling has 
                          already begun and bills are being filed right now. </p>

                              to funding; during session, the Governor's Office 
                              has a meeting to preview filed bills to rate the 
                              bills as A (support it - a &quot;Governor's Bill&quot;); 
                              B (support the bill, will sign, but will not be 
                              consider a &quot;Governor's Bill&quot;); C (neutral 
                              - no support, may or may not sign);D (will not support 
                              or will try to get amended); F (does not support 
                              and will veto);</p>

                            <p>If it has revenue impact, might get bad rating 
                              - but if the Governor vetoes, the legislature might 
                              override the veto;</p>
                          </li>
                          <li> 
                            <p>The bill will need to be tracked throughout the 
                              legislative process;</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Julie emphasized how important it is to not only lobby 
                          for appropriations, but to also be sure and lobby for 
                          funding. Susan Cromwell pointed out that DIS has already 
                          filed its budget, and that whatever appropriation the 
                          Board went after would have to be housed at DIS, because 
                          of legislation. Shelby Johnson commented that it appeared 
                          that the most important route would be to pursue an 
                          amendment process to the DIS appropriation. Julie agreed 
                          and said that this would be possible through a sponsor 
                          in the legislature, like Senator Gordon, but she explained 
                          DIS was given appropriations money in an unanticipated 
                          services fund and recommended that the LIB work through 
                          that category and not through the main department appropriation. 
                          She explained the Board should get the money and then 
                          DIS will amend the appropriation after the session. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Julie explained that the bill would need to be tracked 
                          throughout the legislative process, but that DIS has 
                          a good bill tracking process and DIS will help follow 
                          the legislation for lobbying purposes. She also pointed 
                          out that in terms of funding, it could be possible to 
                          ask other agencies to ask for funding in their budgets 
                          and provide cooperative funding for the LIB projects. 
                          Julie brought up the Department of Finance and Administrations 
                          &quot;Fund Clearinghouse,&quot; where funding may be 
                          requested for projects and suggested that one of the 
                          Board members pursue information regarding how to request 
                          funds from the clearinghouse. She explained that every 
                          director of every agency is on the clearinghouse panel. 
                          Bill Bush commented that he is on that panel and had 
                          participated in the review process, but he did not know 
                          how the application process worked. </p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson asked what would be the best emphasis 
                          would be on a bill in order to catch the Governor's 
                          attention for support on a bill. Julie explained that 
                          economic development is a number one issue for the Governor 
                          and that if a bill could be linked to that topic, it 
                          would be more likely to garner support. She also pointed 
                          out that the Governor is also very interested in technology 
                          issues for the state. Susan Cromwell pointed out that 
                          the concept of accountability is an important topic 
                          regarding legislative initiatives.</p>
                        <p>Julie explained that if the Board would let her know 
                          when a bill was introduced and she would help the Board 
                          track the bill throughout the process, since she would 
                          be doing the same for other legislation. Shelby Johnson 
                          asked how the Board might get involved in the tracking 
                          process, and Julie explained that there is a public 
                          comments time on bills and that is the time to pack 
                          the house with supporters. Suzanne Wiley asked that 
                          if when the bill goes to committee, is there an opportunity 
                          to defend the bill, and Bill Bush explained that the 
                          Board would probably be invited to be there. She said 
                          there are chances at every stage of processing in committee 
                          to support the bill. Julie pointed out that very few 
                          people use the opportunity that is offered to support 
                          bills, but that the people who use it are rewarded. 
                          She also recommended joint filing with co-sponsors from 
                          the House and the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Cullen concluded by telling the members that if 
                          they had any specific questions, they should <a href="mailto:julie.cullen@mail.state.ar.us">contact</a> 
                          her directly.</p>
                        <p><b>Strategic Plan</b></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush explained that he had started working on 
                          the Annual Report, and he used the Mission Statement 
                          in the Report. Shelby Johnson said that he had received 
                          no comments on the Mission Statement, and that the Strategic 
                          Plan had received no comments from other LIB members 
                          as well. Suzanne Wiley expressed the concern that preparing 
                          legislation at this point in time was more important 
                          than completing the Strategic Plan, and Bill Bush concurred. 
                          It was agreed that the members would continue working 
                          on the Plan, but that the Board would focus on legislative 
                          issues for the moment.</p>
                        <p><b>Additional Legislative Discussion</b></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush said that he would look into the Fund Clearinghouse 
                          to see how the Board might apply for funding for proposed 
                          projects. He said that determining the source of revenue 
                          would be the first thing to decide, and that general 
                          revenue funds would be difficult to obtain and would 
                          take lots of justification and would have to be linked 
                          to economic development, etc. He voiced the opinion 
                          that over a longer period of time, it might be possible 
                          to look to the agencies for support and co-funding of 
                          the project. Another thing he suggested was to attach 
                          amendments on to DIS' appropriation bill, and that 
                          if the Board could get appropriations, then if money 
                          could be located it would be possible to spend it. Another 
                          possibility he mentioned was the possibility of getting 
                          federal grants for a startup project, which would require 
                          matching funds, but he added that it is easier to get 
                          matching funds that complete funding. Suzanne Wiley 
                          did point out that this would be a one-shot deal. </p>
                        <p>Bill Bush commented that he had spoken with Ray Fox 
                          regarding the DOQs and that Mr. Fox felt these could 
                          be contracted and completed within a year's time. 
                          He pointed out that asking for funding from the legislature 
                          for a two-year span might make the appropriation more 
                          palatable, but that the DOQs could still be completed 
                          within a year and Mr. Fox was amenable to this. </p>
                        <p>Bill Bush asked the Board to decide exactly how much 
                          money would be needed for the Clearinghouse project, 
                          and Suzanne Wiley said that an RFP would need to be 
                          issued. Shelby Johnson pointed out that it was too late 
                          to do this and the best thing would be to make a reasonable 
                          estimate of the costs. Bill Bush pointed out that the 
                          costs would have to be well justified prior to presentation 
                          for legislative backing. The Board decided to just evaluate 
                          what the bottom line would be, and possibly break it 
                          into sections for hardware, software, support, etc. 
                          Shelby Johnson suggested that the proposal analysis 
                          of the original board from 1994 be used as a guideline 
                          and he agreed to look at the document. Suzanne Wiley 
                          asked as to whether the Board wanted to ask for funding 
                          for an office to support the SLIC position. Bill Bush 
                          commented that after initial legislative funding, it 
                          would be possible to recoup costs by becoming self-supporting 
                          over a period of time. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley made the suggestion that the Board get 
                          something on paper as to what funding was needed, and 
                          then the Board needed to finish the public relations 
                          presentation. Bill Bush recommended that the first thing 
                          would be to contact the Board's official liaison 
                          in the Governor's Office and look into how much 
                          support might be available.</p>
                        <p><b>Next Meeting</b></p>
                        <p> It was decided that the next meeting would be held 
                          on Thursday, December 10, from 9 a.m. to noon, and that 
                          if a quorum could not be present, it might be possible 
                          to arrange a conference call in order to vote on issues.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley volunteered to pull together a rough 
                          draft of legislation together of all the options the 
                          Board wants with some numbers. Bill Bush said he would 
                          get together a draft of the Annual Report and Mission 
                          Statement for the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>
