                        <p>-----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          17th Floor Conference Room, Union Building, in Little 
                          Rock. Minutes from the last meeting were unanimously 
                          approved.</p>
                        <p><b>Reports</b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that she, Randy Jones, Jim 
                          Wells, and Phyllis Smith attended the Governor's seminar 
                          for state board members and that it was very informative. 
                          She recommended that all board members attend this.</p>
                        <h4><em>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson handed out a status report on his recent 
                          activities.&nbsp; He talked about the procedures involved 
                          in getting the LIB recognized as the coordinating body 
                          in Arkansas by the FGDC. He has prepared the response 
                          to be sent to the FGDC secretary. He pointed out that 
                          there is no recognized coordinating council in Arkansas 
                          at this time. Shelby explained that the FGDC will send 
                          back a response recognizing the LIB as the coordinating 
                          body for Arkansas.</p>
                        <p><em><strong>GIS Initiatives List</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reminded the Board that she and Shelby 
                          had met with the Governor several weeks ago to talk 
                          about GIS issues, and that the Governor asked for a 
                          wish list from the Board regarding GIS needs for the 
                          state. He also offered to do an Executive Order to all 
                          state agencies to have them cooperate with the LIB. 
                          He also invited Shelby Johnson to attend the State Agency 
                          Retreat in November to give a presentation to all state 
                          agency directors.</p>
                        <p>Bill Bush made the motion that the Board adopt the 
                          list of initiatives to be passed on to the Governor. 
                          Shirley Sandlin seconded the motion, and the Board unanimously 
                          approved the motion.</p>

                        <p><em><strong>GIS Users Conference Report</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Phyllis Smith next gave a report on the success of 
                          the GIS Users Forum conference in Eureka Springs. Attendance 
                          was very good this year and feedback was positive.</p>
                        <p><em><strong>Committee Reports</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Phyllis Smith said the funding committee has not met. 
                          Several of the committees were scheduled to meet following 
                          the LIB meeting.</p>
                        <p>For the Strategic Planning Committee, Shelby Johnson 
                          reported on the status of the draft Strategic Plan, 
                          which is still in progress. Suzanne Wiley explained 
                          that the Committee was trying to pull together goals 
                          for the LIB.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Report on Statewide Image Coordination</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the LIB is looking very 
                          good in terms of coordinating the acquisition of satellite 
                          data for land use/land cover. He said that at the GIS 
                          Conference it was possible to discuss the merits of 
                          this project with several agency representatives and 
                          to that end about 17 different agencies will participate 
                          in splitting the costs on image acquisition. Through 
                          a single combined purchase a large savings in cost will 
                          be realized. He pointed out that this will be a good 
                          example of where the Board can say its done its job 
                          in terms of coordinating and in saving the state a lot 
                          of money.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Report on GIS Day Proclamation</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush explained that the week of November 12-20 
                          is National Geography Awareness Week and the 19th has 
                          been declared GIS Day. Mr. Bush further explained that 
                          the Governor is being asked to issue a proclamation 
                          for GIS Day and showed the members a copy of the proposed 
                          proclamation. Suzanne Wiley encouraged the members to 
                          promote awareness of GIS Day through their agencies 
                          or communities. Bill Bush made a motion that the LIB 
                          request that November 19th be proclaimed GIS Day in 
                          Arkansas and that the Governor be requested to make 
                          that a proclamation. Phyllis Smith seconded the motion 
                          and it was unanimously approved. Discussion followed 
                          regarding promotion of GIS Day.</p>
                        <p><b>Old Business</b></p>
                        <p><em><strong>Color IR Purchase</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that the USGS is going to fly 
                          aerial photography for the state next Spring of 2000. 
                          The most recent was black and white in 1994. Suzanne 
                          pointed out that having the photography done in color 
                          costs an additionally $180,000. However, several other 
                          state agencies are interested in color IR photography 
                          and this group is having a meeting on October 14 for 
                          discussion regarding whether color IR will benefit everybody 
                          and whether the money can be raised to pay for it. The 
                          State of Louisiana is also participating to assist Arkansas 
                          in the project of color IR photography. Suzanne also 
                          pointed out that when it comes to producing DOQs, there 
                          is no difference in the cost between using color IR 
                          versus black and white. She pointed out that if Arkansas 
                          pays half and the USGS pays half, that comes to about 
                          $1.2 million for Arkansas' half. If several other federal 
                          agencies participate like NRCS or FSA, then the cost 
                          will less. Shelby Johnson pointed out that USGS has 
                          already budgeted for black and white in early 2000, 
                          so the state will be flown even if extra funding for 
                          the color IR does not happen. He added that the Forestry 
                          Service would be interested in supporting this effort 
                          with money, but how much remains to be seen at the meeting 
                          on the 14th.</p>
                        <p>Phyllis Smith said that she and Shelby had been visiting 
                          with Ted Mullinex, who is the lobbyist that the surveyors 
                          hired to help push through the program in Monticello. 
                          She discussed the possibilities of using his services 
                          to assist with promoting the efforts of the Board but 
                          that at this time there seemed to be no way to handle 
                          doing this.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reminded the members that at the last 
                          meeting the Board passed a motion to support CAST in 
                          its efforts to continue second-year research on SWAG. 
                          Involved in that was a letter to the Governor recommending 
                          his releasing the funds for the second year of funding. 
                          She explained that she had not submitted the letter 
                          because SWAG was listed as an item in the LIB initiatives 
                          that were presented to the Governor. Suzanne explained 
                          that if there is no response on SWAG funding as it is 
                          presented in the list, then she will go ahead with a 
                          separate letter regarding funding to CAST for SWAG completion.</p>

                        <p><em><strong>Governor's Technology Initiative</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell explained that the GTI is currently 
                          being defined and that the Governor himself has yet 
                          to define his initiative, though we hope to have confirmation 
                          soon. One element called Communities of Interest is 
                          to go through workshops and processes to be able to 
                          have an outcome the demonstrates the integration of 
                          the project. Money that was thought to be allocated 
                          had not been allocated and the initial workshops had 
                          to be postponed. Suzanne Wiley asked what this Initiative 
                          will do for the LIB and GIS in Arkansas and Susan explained 
                          that it wasn't yet clear how the processes will benefit 
                          the LIB; that will be up to the LIB. The orientation 
                          session will lay out the tools and processes and the 
                          Chair and Co-Chair can evaluate their usefulness to 
                          the LIB. She explained that part of the strategy is 
                          that once the different pieces are dovetailed for integrating 
                          IT projects in the state with changes in network provider 
                          participation and combined with fundraising, then maybe 
                          there would be some cash for LIB projects.</p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson commented that the positive impacts 
                          are that that Initiative is to build a unified technology 
                          budget for the next legislative session. He pointed 
                          out that there are three communities of interest: the 
                          statewide radio network; the statewide distance learning 
                          network; spatial technologies, and possibly the integrated 
                          justice system. Suzanne Wiley added that the Board has 
                          been invited to participate and that there will be good 
                          PR opportunities for the Board resulting from this involvement.</p>
                        <p><b>Comments</b></p>
                        <p>Brian Culpepper of CAST remarked that in relation to 
                          the SWAG funding that the key part of the second phase 
                          is raster integration to the data model. He commented 
                          that it appeared that there will be quite an investment 
                          statewide in raster data with the more recent landsat 
                          imagery acquisition, etc. He also commented that if 
                          the audit and inventory is funded, the process of dovetailing 
                          and customization of how that product works and how 
                          people receive data would be a great opportunity for 
                          the Board to provide input to that team as to what would 
                          be most useful for the state users.</p>
                        <p>Joe Bob Penor commented that the GIS Forum is working 
                          on trying to get a Technical Advisory Committee together. 
                          The primary task will be to work on initiatives and 
                          issues for the LIB. He explained that once the TAC is 
                          formed, the members will be regularly involved in the 
                          LIB meetings. Also, another TAC job will be to form 
                          subcommittees for special issues. Joe Bob also expressed 
                          his desire for the GIS Users Forum members to be more 
                          active with the LIB.</p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson offered the information that the American 
                          Congress on Surveying and Mapping Year 2000 meeting, 
                          which is being sponsored by the ASPS, is going to be 
                          in Little Rock. He pointed out that this is a major 
                          national meeting that relates to surveying, GIS and 
                          GPS. He explained that this would be a great opportunity 
                          for the Forum to work with the ASPS in terms of sponsoring 
                          that somehow. Randy Jones pointed out that they will 
                          need lots of volunteers because it's a big meeting. 
                          Joe Bob Penor said hopefully he can get some volunteers.</p>
                        <p><b>Next Meeting</b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that the surveyors had their annual 
                          meeting a few weeks ago and that they are redefining 
                          surveying in Arkansas. She explained that within the 
                          last year there have been a lot of things happening 
                          in California regarding conflicts between GIS users 
                          and surveyors and how the laws should be interpreted. 
                          The Arkansas surveyors have appointed a group to look 
                          into what the current law states and what modifications 
                          it might need, if any, and to investigate the possibilities. 
                          Suzanne explained that it was important to keep up with 
                          that issue in order to cooperate with any changes that 
                          may be at hand and be a part of resolving any conflicts 
                          that may arise, and also to educate GIS users to surveyors' 
                          needs and vice versa. She said she has invited Tom Webb 
                          to speak at the next Board meeting regarding this issue.</p>
                        <p>The date of the next meeting was discussed and it was 
                          decided to meet on November 19th to coincide with GIS 
                          Day. Randy Jones will look into First Electric Corporation 
                          hosting a lunch for legislators that afternoon following 
                          the LIB meeting. The date of December 9 was set as a 
                          tentative meeting date for that month.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
