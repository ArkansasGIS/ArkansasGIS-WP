                          groups, both federal and state agencies. He went over

                        <p>Suzanne Wiley pointed out that November 19 is GIS Day 
                          in Arkansas as proclaimed by the Governor. She explained 
                          that the LIB would be hosting a group of legislators 
                          in the afternoon and that there is an exhibit in the 
                          Rotunda highlighting GIS projects from around the state.</p>
                        <p><em><strong>Governor's Retreat</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush explained that Shelby Johnson gave a very 
                          nice overview presentation regarding the LIB and other 
                          activities. He felt that the agency directors were well 
                          informed. Regarding the possibility of a statewide GIS 
                          audit, he recommended getting a letter out to all the 
                          agency directors as to a timeframe and ask that they 
                          reply with a contact name for this process.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley asked if the LIB Audit Committee had 
                          made any progress regarding a questionnaire. Randy Jones 
                          explained that professional consultation would be helpful 
                          to draw up the questions, which would take some funding. 
                          He said that the Audit Committee had put the questionnaire 
                          on the back burner while this avenue is explored. He 
                          explained that they were starting to work on a mailing 
                          list for an audit mailing.</p>
                        <p><em><strong>Governor's Technology Initiative</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell passed out a diagram depicting the different 
                          strategic pieces of Arkansas' technology planning that 
                          presents a direction for the next legislative session. 
                          She explained that one category of planning is key state 
                          projects that have been defined by legislation and that 
                          require multi-agency integrated efforts, which includes 
                          the public safety radio network, distance learning, 
                          workforce investment, spatial technology, criminal justice 
                          information, etc. Another category of planning is represented 
                          by community coalitions and she explained that through 
                          outreach efforts, specific communities are starting 
                          with collaborative work. This is entailing identifying 
                          the communities, having them work toward the development 
                          of local infrastructures to support themselves, and 
                          then achieving connection to the state backbone. Ms. 
                          Cromwell explained that Nortel Consultant Service has 
                          been contracted to apply a strategic planning process 
                          to all these efforts. All these efforts will support 
                          the integration of the state backbone network resources 
                          out to all communities in the state.</p>
                        <p>Susan then mentioned that Suzanne Wiley, Jim Wells, 
                          and Shelby Johnson attended an orientation session on 
                          November 15 that was given by Nortel in order to assess 
                          whether this process would have any pertinence to the 
                          Land Information Board. Suzanne Wiley explained that 
                          the Land Information Board is being invited to a special 
                          series of training sessions being presented by Nortel 
                          Consultants on December 9th. She felt that this will 
                          help the Board clarify its strategic plan and vision, 
                          as well as getting the message out to other Boards, 
                          Commissions and Agencies regarding what technology can 
                          do for them. She encouraged the members to attend this 
                          training session.</p>
                        <p><em><strong>Introduction of Governor's Senior Technical 
                          Advisor</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley introduced Don Melton, Governor's Technical 
                          Liaison, to the members of the Board. Mr. Melton explained 
                          that technology issues will be the centerpiece of the 
                          Governor's legislative package in 2001 and that it is 
                          his responsibility to try to get a handle on all the 
                          technology issues and come up with a plan that is logical 
                          and achievable.</p>

                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that at the GIS Users Forum 
                          Conference following Ray Fox's presentation, the possibility 
                          of Color Infrared Photography for Arkansas was discussed. 
                          In October there was a second meeting regarding this 
                          subject. Various interested agencies were involved in 
                          that meeting and some representatives from Louisiana 
                          came to the meeting and spoke about their state's efforts.</p>
                        <p>Pam Smith from NRCS explained that interest was raised 
                          regarding an innovative partnership. She explained that 
                          the national office was receptive, with the requirement 
                          that NRCS, the Forest Service, and FSA would have to 
                          sign a letter of intent towards a state partnership, 
                          with a state agency leading. It would be a 50/50 split 
                          between the feds and the state. The total would approximately 
                          $386,000 to be split between the state and the feds, 
                          which would strictly cover the flight costs. Pam explained 
                          that a commitment would have to be made soon by the 
                          state for a 2000 NAPP flight or 2001.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne said at the October meeting it was agreed to 
                          pursue this issue further, which is why it had been 
                          brought before the Board. She recalled that Act 914 
                          of 1997 mandates the Board to cooperate with the USGS 
                          in the development of digital data, as well as the mandate 
                          to identify issues, problems and solutions in implementing 
                          an overall land and geographic resources program. She 
                          pointed out that this is an issue that will affect federal 
                          partners, state agencies, cities and counties so the 
                          LIB is in the position of making the best decision to 
                          provide a solution for the state.</p>
                        <p><em><strong>Committee Reports</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Phyllis Smith said the Funding Committee had been unable 
                          to meet due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Jubal Smith reported that the Communications Committee 
                          planned to meet that afternoon to discuss ways to publicize 
                          the LIB and the State Land Information Coordinator. 
                          He explained that he had sent information to the media 
                          regarding the GIS Day events that were scheduled.</p>
                        <p>The Legislative Committee has been unable to meet.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell said that the Strategic Planning Committee 
                          had not met, but reminded the LIB that the whole Board 
                          will be meeting on December 9th regarding planning. 
                          She asked the members to reexamine the existing strategic 
                          plan draft prior to that date and try to come up with 
                          issues that need to be considered regarding tactical 
                          planning.</p>
                        <p><b>New Business</b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley welcomed and introduced Fred Limp, Director 
                          of CAST, as a new LIB member.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Wiley explained next that two vendors were there 
                          to give presentations regarding options providing NAPP 
                          data and DOQs for the state. She introduced Stephen 
                          Herbert and Rodger Phelps from the 3001 company and 
                          they went through their company presentation for the 
                          Board and guests. The second presentation was given 
                          by Michael O'Connell from the Pixxures company.</p>
                        <p>Following the vendor presentations, Ms. Wiley invited 
                          Ray Fox of the USGS to give an overview. He explained 
                          that he spoke before the GIS Users Forum and talked 
                          then about how the USGS was planning to fly new NAPP 
                          imagery in 2000 in black and white. He said that he 
                          received feedback from the attendees that the state 
                          was interested in color photography. Mr. Fox explained 
                          that if the state does not want the USGS to fly Arkansas 
                          this flying season in black and white, they needed to 
                          know as soon as possible. He understood that the state 
                          might need to delay in order to get funding arranged 
                          for color photorgraphy, and he emphasized that the USGS 
                          will do what the state wants. He said they could do 
                          the DOQs either through a standard cooperative agreement 
                          with the USGS or through an innovative partnership. 
                          He said that the bottom line is that the innovative 
                          partnerships are cheaper for them and the state gets 
                          something it wants because it's managing the project. 
                          Mr. Fox emphasized that the Board and agencies would 
                          need to let his agency know as soon as possible what 
                          the state wants to do so that the USGS can plan for 
                          it.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley then invited the LIB to discuss the color 
                          infrared photography project. She stressed that the 
                          Board needs to decide what to do in regards to the project 
                          and explained that if the state chooses to go with an 
                          innovative partnership, the USGS will take the state 
                          off the bid list for black and white photography and 
                          the state will have to contract with a vendor for whatever 
                          product is decided to be the best for the state.</p>
                        <p>Discussion followed regarding the photography options 
                          for the state. Following this discussion, Shirley Sandlin 
                          made the motion that the USGS be notified that Arkansas 
                          does not want to be included in the aerial photography 
                          for the Year 2000, but that they keep the state on the 
                          list for 2001. The Board continued discussion regarding 
                          this motion.</p>
                        <p>The Board recessed for lunch with the legislators at 
                          noon and reconvened at 2:30 p.m.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion, the Board returned to the 
                          motion on the floor which was retracted. Susan Cromwell 
                          then made an amended motion to pursue color IR imagery 
                          for the state. Shirley Sandlin seconded the motion, 
                          a vote was taken, and the motion passed with Jim Wells 
                          abstaining and Bill Bush opposing.</p>
                        <p>It was decided that the state would asked to be removed 
                          from the USGS list for the Year 2000 for black and white 
                          photography, but that the state would like to remain 
                          on the USGS list for 2001 either for black and white 
                          photography or for a partnership for infrared photography.</p>
                        <p>Fred Limp next made a motion that the Board will do 
                          the research necessary to identify exactly what the 
                          data requirements are for various communities, what 
                          the cost will be, and will have a plan in place to initiaite 
                          an effort to find out what the state needs to do by 
                          March 1999. Randy Jones seconded the motion. The motion 
                          passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p>It was next decided that an audit was the next step 
                          to do the best job for the State of Arkansas and funding 
                          sources were discussed. Bill Bush stated that the Governor's 
                          Office should be made aware of the priority of the audit 
                          and that funding is necessary; the costs of the CIR 
                          photography; and the costs of the DOQQ costs; and the 
                          time frame for the projects. Mr. Bush suggested that 
                          it might be possible to put funds for the USGS black 
                          and white photography into the CIR photography.</p>
                        <p>Fred Limp agreed to pursue vendor quotes for costs 
                          involved in CIR photography and will get the information 
                          to the members as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Shirley Sandlin made the motion that Mr. Bush pursue 
                          the possibility of carrying the USGS black and white 
                          photography funding over into the CIR photography. Phyllis 
                          Smith seconded the motion. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
                        <p>Phyllis Smith suggested that the Board carry out a 
                          sample cost/benefit analysis of a local community in 
                          order to give hard figures to the Governor's Office 
                          regarding the benefits of the CIR photography.</p>
                        <p><b>Next Meeting</b></p>
                        <p>The next meeting was scheduled for December 9, with 
                          the location to be announced as soon as it is available.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
