                        <p>Mr. William Bush, Arkansas Geological Commission<br />

                        <p>Renata McDaniel, Intern for State Land Information 
                          Coordinator's Office</p>
                        <p>---------------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley, Chairperson, called for approval of 
                          last month's minutes. A motion was made to accept the 
                          minutes, the motion was seconded, and the minutes from 
                          June 23, 1999, were unanimously approved as read.</p>
                        <p><b>Arkansas Technology Summit</b></p>
                        <p>The members then discussed the success of the Arkansas 
                          Technology Summit and agreed that there was a very favorable 
                          response from the attendees and legislators. Suzanne 
                          Wiley thanked Shelby Johnson for coordinating the GIS 
                          information room at the Summit and noted that there 
                          was a lot of traffic through the exhibit. Shelby Johnson 
                          pointed out that Representative Brenda Gullett is very 
                          interested in supporting GIS issues in the future. </p>
                        <p><b>State Land Information Coordinator Report</b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reported on his meeting with John Bethel 
                          at the PSC to talk about telecommunications in the state 
                          and described a meeting with the ARIES project people, 
                          who are defining an architecture for a GIS system to 
                          do client tracking. He also attended a meeting in Shreveport 
                          to meet with the GIS division of Arkla Gas and met with 
                          the Arkansas Telephone Association to look at their 
                          mapping needs. He also pointed out that the Telephone 
                          Association will meet in September and he will probably 
                          do a presentation at that meeting. Shelby went on to 
                          describe the Aurora Partnership, a public private collaboration 
                          group that is working on place-based decision making, 
                          which includes the USGS, federal agencies, private agencies, 
                          and businesses who do location siting. They will have 
                          a meeting in Fayettevillle to be hosted by CAST on September 
                          28 and 29 and it will include panels, demonstrations 
                          and sessions. He pointed out this will be a good chance 
                          for the LIB to do a presentation. </p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson then reported on the activities of the 
                          State Land Information Coordinator's Office. There have 
                          been meetings with EAST to look at strategic planning. 
                          Plans are that there will be an EAST school in every 
                          county in the state, which will bring the present number 
                          of 30 to approximately 60. He announced that CAST is 
                          spearheading a push for a statewide cooperative image 
                          purchase to do three seasons 1999 imagery and that they 
                          are seeking additional partners to go in on this project. 
                          The total cost will be about $88,000 for the data. This 
                          would entitled all those cooperating to a copy of the 
                          raw data which could be used for their own classification 
                          and analysis, with the ultimate goal of developing a 
                          1999 land use/land cover statewide. This is a key piece 
                          of data that has been identified as being essential 
                          for the state. Shelby suggested that the LIB should 
                          somehow endorse this project and participate in any 
                          way possible. He continued with a brief update on the 
                          National Geodetic Survey, which is again looking at 
                          revisiting the HARN sites in Arkansas. There will be 
                          some kind of coordination meeting in August or September 
                          and the point of contact at this time is Mike Garner. 
                          Shelby suggested that the Board needs to consider playing 
                          a role in that project, as well.</p>
                        <p>Shelby then covered the meetings he will be attending, 
                          which include: </p>

                          <p><b>HARN Project</b></p>
                          <p>Suzanne Wiley discussed the fact that supporting 
                            the HARN project and the statewide land cover project 
                            would be worthy goals. Bill Bush moved that the LIB 
                            support the HARN project, Shirley Sandlin seconded 
                            the motion, and it was unanimously approved. Next, 
                            Bill Bush moved that the LIB endorse the statewide 
                            spatial data infrastructure program and encourage 
                            agencies which have the money to participate. This 
                            was seconded by Jubal Smith and it was unanimously 
                            approved. It was agreed that Shelby Johnson will draw 
                            up the draft support letters and send them to project 
                            coordinators.</p>
                          <p><b>GIS Users Forum Conference</b></p>
                          <p>Phyllis Smith next gave an update on the GIS Users 
                            Forum Conference. More abstracts have been received 
                            and speakers are being scheduled. Representative Brenda 
                            Gullett will be a keynote speaker and EAST will be 
                            participating. Discussion followed regarding how to 
                            draw more cities and counties into involvement with 
                            the GIS Users Forum and general statewide GIS planning. 
                          </p>
                          <p><b>Old Business</b></p>
                          <p>Suzanne Wiley opened the topic of old business and 
                            pointed out that there were questions regarding the 
                            status of the DOQs. She pointed out that the cost 
                            of finishing the DOQs is needed prior to the next 
                            legislative session. </p>
                          <p>The subject of a steering committee or advisory group 
                            was discussed. Suzanne Wiley introduced a list of 
                            agency participants from the old steering committee 
                            and she asked for additions or changes from the members. 
                            She proposed that once members were recruited for 
                            this committee, the LIB should try to have one or 
                            two meetings a year with to get feedback from the 
                            members, to update them on what the LIB is doing, 
                            and to solicit support for legislative activities. 
                            Discussion followed regarding the potential membership 
                            of this proposed committee.</p>
                          <p><b>New Business</b></p>
                          <p>The members next discussed the LIB GIS presentation 
                            that will be given to the Joint Committee on Advanced 
                            Communications and Information Technology on August 
                            17. Shelby Johnson pointed out that this will be a 
                            good opportunity to reach key people regarding the 
                            activities of the LIB and the need for supporting
