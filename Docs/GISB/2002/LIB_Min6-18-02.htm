                        <p align="left">Shelby Johnson explained that we now have 
                          a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding between USGS 
                          and the Land Information Board. The objective is to 
                          establish a framework for technology transfer and testing 
                          concepts of the National Map. Kari Kraun, current Chief 
                          of the Mid Continent Mapping Center and Mark Coppersmith, 
                          our State Liaison, will be here in Little Rock on July 
                          2, 2002 to tour the Geographic Information Office and 
                          the USGS Water Resources Division, Little Rock Office. 
                          The purpose will be to explore the placement of a person 
                          on detail from National Mapping Division to Arkansas 
                          as a part of our National Map Pilot activities and National 
                          Map Research activities. USGS is calling this activity 
                          a Mapping Partnership Office. Shelby is hopeful and 
                          has been told Arkansas ranks high in their selection 
                          criteria for placement and they are looking at placing 
                          someone in 2003 or 2004. Depending on budget and resources, 
                          according to Shelby&#146;s assessment, USGS will probably 
                          place about seven people in Mapping Partnerships. These 
                          seven placements will be distributed between sixteen 
                          or seventeen states. Since these are not new positions, 
                          they will have to find people within the existing framework 
                          of the organization that are willing to be placed in 
                          the different areas. </p>

                          executed with the USGS Data Center that will enable 
                          the move forward with scene acquisition. No other coordination 
                          has taken place with the consortium membership. Later 
                          in the fall or winter another scene acquisition will 
                          be done based on consortium interest.</p>

                          to trickle in. USGS files are received weekly and are 
                          being passed on to USGS after copies are made. There 
                          are still sixty - seven DOQQ.s remaining to be created. 
                          The flying has been completed but they are working on 
                          processing them through. Since the last board meeting 
                          sixty potential rejections have been sent for various 
                          items. They are working on reprocessing those and we 
                          will be getting some updated DOQQ&#146;s to replace 
                          them. The state portion should be wrapped up by the

                          will continue on the plan. It will remain on the table

                        <p align="left">Shelby reported a conference call was 
                          held on May 29, 2002 between the National Mapping Division, 
                          CAST, and the Forest Resource Institute. The purpose 
                          of the call was to discuss some national map pilot project 
                          follow up activity from the MOU. The goal was to explore 
                          national map issues along state borders using open GIS 
                          standards. Action items resulting from the discussion 
                          were, CAST will provide USGS a password access which 
                          will allow them direct connect and CAST will provide 
                          USGS with a White Paper on the GeoStore technical architecture. 
                          Both things have been completed. USGS will provide a 
                          staffer to review the GeoStor architecture from remote 
                          connection.</p>

                          formal resolutions or thoughts on how to respond to 
                          their questions, particularly related to policies and

                          from the Open GIS Consortium to add a number of new 
                          capacities into GeoStor. As OGC compliant capacities 
                          are made available anywhere GeoStor will be one of the 
                          first locations in the world that has that kind of capacity. 
                          At this point it appears that GeoStor will be the largest 
                          single comprehensive data stor that is available with 
                          OGC service plugged into it. OGC develops use cases 
                          which are test pilots. There is a very good chance that 
                          GeoStor will be the use case demonstration. This means 
                          all of the development work done in OGC for the Geo

                        <p align="left">Shelby reported that the Critical Infrastructure 
                          Protection Initiative is underway. This initiative takes 
                          advantage of GIS techniques and methods and then deals 
                          with critical infrastructure data sets. They participated 
                          in an on line survey from OGC and the Spatial Information 
                          Technology Association and submitted Arkansas as being 
                          interested in testing models, testing cases, testing 
                          technique, and testing methods. Concurrent with that, 
                          through FGDC, there is a homeland security working group. 
                          The FGDC has developed a draft list of four hundred 
                          odd features that they have determined are critical 
                          infrastructure. From that the National States Geographic 
                          Information Council has been asked to respond on behalf 
                          of all the states. Shelby has submitted Arkansas&#146; 
                          response. Shelby&#146;s assessment is that Arkansas 
                          has about two percent to five percent of what they are 
                          going to want from this activity. It is basically data 
                          that has been created through other projects that have 
                          produced certain elements of this list. Of that two 
                          to five percent we would have to go back and verify 
                          and update data. </p>
                        <p align="left">Somewhere around 10% of the data exists 
                          in the spatial format. It leaves about 85% of the data 
                          on the list as needing to be developed in Arkansas. 
                          It is a concern that we may receive an uncoordinated 
                          mandate or worse an unfunded mandate. Somewhere between 
                          98 and 100% of the elements that are listed in that 
                          draft list have an address. A concern was sent back 
                          inquiring why so much time should be spent nationwide, 
                          focusing on the four hundred critical infrastructure 
                          elements and trying to map them when if we had a nationwide, 
                          current, accurate, reliable and maintained centerline 
                          data base, we could geo code data as they are changed 
                          from time to time to generate a reliable geo coded point 
                          for data. This would serve far more than homeland security. 
                          Our response to FGDC is, other than focusing on other 
                          things, we should build an enabling data set such as 
                          centerlines that will provide us true answers.</p>

                          from the board on the Centerline File Standards. Learon 
                          explained that as local data is received it gets molded 
                          into the statewide centerline file standard. Shelby 
                          pointed out that there are number of Arkansas counties 
                          that have implemented 911 and done mapping. Out of those 
                          counties that have developed 911 systems and built a 
                          centerline file to support the 911, most have a different 
                          way of implementing the underlying data structure. In 
                          their centerline research the team pulled together a 
                          query and the only set that currently exists that supports 
                          this kind of application is Tiger. Fifty eight percent 
                          of all road segments in that data base do not have a

                          of any kind the best and quickest way to locate where 
                          those things came from is through address matching and 
                          Geo coding. This depends on having a high quality centerline

                          a proposed model law for how the survey community establishes 
                          licenses. She suggested the board read over the material 
                          and stay informed of on-going discussions. </p>
                        <p align="left"><b><em>GIS Certification</em></b></p>
                        <p align="left">Mike Garner reported that the only people 
                          certification would impact and benefit are people who 
                          do not have strong academic backgrounds in GIS. He distributed 
                          a handout explaining the different definitions for an 
                          individual doing GIS licensing. He explained that a 
                          significant number of people in GIS have not had an 
                          academic background. Certification programs recognize 
                          academics as a requirement and we do not have people 
                          in the state that meet that requirement. The committee 
                          is monitoring the efforts of certification in the state.
