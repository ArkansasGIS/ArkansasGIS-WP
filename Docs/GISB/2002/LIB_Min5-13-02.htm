                        <h3 align="left"> Report of the State Geographic Information 
                          Coordinator</h3>
                        <h4 align="left"><em>PCI Imaging Software Training</em></h4>
                        <p align="left">Shelby Johnson reported that they traveled 
                          to Fairfax, Virginia for training on the satellite imaging 
                          remote sensing software package that will be used in 
                          the office. It is the primary tool that handles all 
                          of the Raster functions on GeoStor in Fayetteville. 
                          He explained there were several things they learned 
                          in the training that will benefit the office and the 
                          board down the road. One of the features this software 
                          provides is a DOQQ Generation component so we would 
                          have the capacity to generate our own DOQQ&#146;s if 
                          it was ever needed.</p>
                        <h4 align="left"><em>USGS State Mapping Workshop</em></h4>
                        <p align="left">The State Mapping Workshops are workshops 
                          that are held for the different regions of the USGS 
                          as it relates to the National Mapping Division. One 
                          of the things this workshop is designed to do is to 
                          allow the USGS to interact with the State and local 
                          Governments to get feedback, listen to concerns and 
                          suggestions about the mapping program and various activities 
                          that they undertake. Shelby attended the workshop representing 
                          the State of Arkansas and also representing the National 
                          States Geographic Information Council. One of the most 
                          significant things learned was that now under the National 
                          Map Program they are interested in taking advantage 
                          of higher resolution, higher quality local level data 
                          in the national map effort. Another significant thing 
                          learned was the &#147;One Hundred Twenty Cities&#148; 
                          effort. The list of cities was devised by the National 
                          Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), the mapping arm of 
                          the U.S. Department of Defense. Their role in mapping 
                          has been to find and archive map information about places, 
                          usually on foreign soil, and supply mapping information 
                          to different branches of the Department of Defense for 
                          planning. </p>
                        <p align="left">Shortly after September 11 the Department 
                          of Defense for the first time in many years looked internally 
                          at the quality of the mapping information inside the 
                          U. S. borders. They tasked NIMA with the role of developing 
                          map data sets for the U. S. that are strategic points. 
                          NIMA recognized that they did not have expertise in 
                          that area so they came to USGS National Mapping Division 
                          and asked USGS to help coordinate local, best-in-class 
                          data for these one hundred twenty cities. The purpose 
                          of this activity is to build best available data sets 
                          that are in the public domain for the use of first responders 
                          in the event of an attack or in response to a disaster 
                          or emergency. One of the things USGS has been doing 
                          is absorbing this high-level data development activity 
                          from within their existing budget. One of the things 
                          they are doing now is recognizing state boards, state 
                          councils, and state coordinators and asking their coordination 
                          and recruiting people to work on ensuring that we pull 
                          together the best local-level data. Initial activity 
                          has centered on contacting Chuck Baclawski and the Pulaski 
                          area GIS and begin to look at some of the high level 
                          data that they have available. </p>
                        <p align="left">NIMA has built a draft of critical infrastructure 
                          feature types that will be included in this one hundred 
                          twenty cities project. Nationwide, for these one hundred 
                          twenty cities, they are looking for high quality location 
                          data which include things like banking and finance, 
                          government buildings, schools, hospitals, water treatment 
                          facilities, bridges, airports and typical things that 
                          a first responder would need to know. NIMA has placed 
                          four million dollars in funding for this effort and 
                          USGS has placed one million dollars for a total of five 
                          million dollars in the effort to focus on acquiring 
                          &#147;best in class&#148; data for these one hundred 
                          twenty cities. &#147;Best in class data&#148; is defined 
                          as most recent and best resolution or best scale.</p>
                        <h4 align="left"><em>National Map</em></h4>
                        <p align="left">Shelby reported that the National Map 
                          activity is moving forward. They just rolled out the 
                          state of Delaware and the state of Utah. We hope to 
                          also get Arkansas involved and on the agenda to be a 
                          national map site. We have in draft form a MOU between 
                          the state and USGS for the national map which effectively 
                          says both the USGS and the state of Arkansas are interested 
                          in working together on the national map.</p>
                        <h4 align="left"><em>America View Consortium</em></h4>
                        <p align="left">An example of a recent graphic utilizing 
                          data through the Arkansas America View method which 
                          utilizes GeoStor, along with a press release was sent 
                          out to all of the members of the Arkansas Press Association. 
                          To our knowledge we don&#146;t know of anyone publishing 
                          it. More importantly the press release and the graphics 
                          were sent to the Congressional Delegation in D.C. with 
                          a cover letter that explained that these are the kinds 
                          of products and examples of things that we could do 
                          in Arkansas, if in the future Congress decided to put 
                          dollars in the program to expand the America View program. 
                          We have gotten positive responses from Senator Lincoln&#146;s 
                          office and Congressman Barry&#146;s office. They have 
                          put in letters of request to the chairman of the Interior 
                          Appropriations Committee. After speaking with the person 
                          working on this project in D.C. they do not anticipate 
                          the funding will come through in FY 03. There may be 
                          opportunity for funding in FY 04. . </p>
                        <h4 align="left"><em>AR Digital Ortho Program</em></h4>
                        <p align="left">Shelby passed out an email from Ralph 
                          Storey informing him that as of April 26, 2002 the USGS 
                          has completed the final inspection and acceptance for 
                          the Arkansas NAPP specification photography flown for

                        <p align="left">Shelby reported that in his absence Learon 
                          lead the Centerline I Team meeting. He announced the 
                          addition of LeAnn Winston to the staff. She will be 
                          assisting with writing activities and will help in getting 
                          us published in different places. Shelby said out of 
                          all the data sets that we have studied in the I Team

                          started this project and they have not been able to

                          due to lack of expertise and skill sets. They are going 
                          to actively be working with the GIS Applications Lab 
                          at UALR. Phyllis Smith will be leading this effort. 
                          A couple of people from Phyllis&#146;s office will be 
                          assisting us in completing the Mosaics of the ADOP data

                          not have the authority to set surveying standards. He 
                          suggested they be developed by the land survey office 
                          since they have the legislative authority. Susan will

                          lot of people enthused about taking a look at this standard. 
                          A list serve was created and a website developed to 
                          survey people about the SDSFIE. Training is bottle necked 
                          at this time. In order to get a training class locally 
                          on the standard from the Corps of Engineers will cost 
                          $10,000.00. The other alternative would be to attend 
                          classes in Vicksburg. There is an initiative being taken 
                          to get someone from Vicksburg to come here and do a 
                          one morning or afternoon presentation on the standard.

                          of the Department of Emergency Management who is also 
                          the head of the Homeland Security efforts in Arkansas, 
                          organized a meeting of all state agency executives. 
                          The State of Arkansas Homeland Security Overview and 
                          Initial Status Report was passed out to the group. Learon 
                          pointed out that GIS was not mentioned during the meeting 
                          or in the report. He did have a small opportunity to 
                          explain what GIS was. He said it did spark some interest 
                          and he had some questions after the meeting concerning 
                          GIS. Learon proposed to the board that a letter/formatted 
                          document be prepared that can be directly inserted into 
                          the initial Homeland Security document to describe the 
                          background and who the board is and what the Geographic 
                          Information Office is and list the strengths and weaknesses. 
                          The Department of Emergency Management will have an 
                          important role in how federal funds are distributed. 
                          Input to the initial document might ensure we would 
                          not miss out on potential funds that might come down 
                          through the Department of Emergency Management. There 
                          was no deadline but Learon indicated it should be done

                        <p align="left">Shelby said he expected the surveyors 
                          will ask that we be involved in the plat filing activity. 
                          With that in mind he related the board needs to be knowledgeable 
                          about and plan to make a position on it. He also mentioned 
                          the Assessment Coordination Department has thirty one 
                          counties that will start their second cycle of reappraisal 
                          and as a part of that they are asking those counties 
                          to plan for special projects. One of the things they 
                          have listed as a special project is their mapping. </p>
                        <p align="left">Shelby said they recently had an opportunity 
                          to present an hour presentation on mapping and the use 
                          of GeoStor to these counties. There is a plan to do 
                          a GeoStor workshop for assessors to show them how GeoStor 
                          works and show them what data is in GeoStor that they 
                          might be able to use. Shelby related that this is not 
                          a legislative activity but our law tells us that we 
                          are suppose to develop an implementation cost plan for 
                          statewide.</p>
                        <p align="left"> There was discussion concerning protocol
