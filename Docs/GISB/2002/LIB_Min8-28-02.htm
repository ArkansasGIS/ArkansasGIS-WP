                          and Regulations Committee for final review. One technical 
                          amendment to the standard has been identified, concerning 
                          driveways. The amendment is, if a driveway is 500 feet 
                          or longer and or has two or more addressable structures, 
                          that driveway should be mapped. This incorporation will 
                          be made into the standard and it will be passed before 
                          the review board.<br />
                          <br />
                          Shelby elaborated on how important the centerline program 
                          is to the state. He gave an example of an evacuation 
                          notification in Columbia County that did not include 
                          all of the streets. The county purchased a system from 
                          a vendor who claimed would be at a certain percentage 
                          accurate. After an investigation it was found that commercially 
                          enhanced Tiger Data is not remotely accurate enough 
                          for the application. If the centerline standard had 
                          been in place this could have been avoided. If standards 
                          are in place and if a vendor wants commercially enhance 
                          for a particular area, our standards would be used and 
                          thereby achieve greater accuracy and consistency statewide.

                          Committee on Advanced Communication and Information 
                          Technology, Representative Ted Mullinx made a presentation 
                          about their report. They plan to bring some legislative 
                          changes and some appropriation to begin work on the 
                          development of an electronic plat filing system. The 
                          system would be administered by the State Land Surveyors 
                          Office. It would enable the surveyor the capability 
                          to use all of his technology to produce a file, port 
                          it to a portable document format, and then file it on 
                          line rather than filing it in several different places

                            members is that database standardization is a necessary 
                            next step to ensure that total return on investment 
                            is achieved by AGIO projects such as GeoStor and the 
                            centerline projects. The board reviewed the recommendations. 
                            A motion was made to accept SDSFIE as a spatial data

                            thing in implementing this program. Communities are 
                            using these maps to determine who is in the flood 
                            plain and who needs to develop to the standards of 
                            their ordinance. Most of the maps being used are old 
                            maps from the 70&#8217;s. Now for the first time official 
                            FEMA maps can be obtained on line and downloaded.
