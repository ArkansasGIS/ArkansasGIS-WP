                        <p align="left">The meeting was called to order. Suzanne 
                          Wiley motved to approve as amended the minutes of the 
                          last meeting of January 29, 2003. Shirley Sandlin seconded 
                          the motion. The minutes were approved as amended and 
                          accepted unanimously.</p>
                        <h3 align="left">Report from the Arkansas Geographic Information 
                          Office</h3>
                        <p>The standard AGIO report was not given due to the time 
                          required to discuss pressing legislative issues. Mr. 
                          Johnson began by providing an overview of the AGIO&#8217;s 
                          current budget dilemma.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson explained that seven GIS positions were 
                          created during the 83rd General Assembly by passing 
                          ACT 1499. The appropriation for those seven positions 
                          was requested in the DIS appropriation. Concurrently, 
                          two GIS positions were created in the Act creating the 
                          Office of Information Technology appropriation. Both 
                          appropriations were approved by the Arkansas 83rd General 
                          Assembly. The positions in the DIS appropriation remained 
                          unfilled.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson went on to explain that an appropriation 
                          gives the entity the authority to spend the money, funding 
                          gives the entity the money to spend, and approved budget 
                          is what is planned to be spent during a biennium. On 
                          January 10th, the 84th General Assembly Legislative 
                          Council Joint Budget Committee, Constitutional Officers 
                          Subcommittee adopted a motion that budget for any general 
                          revenue, State Central Services or Constitutional Officers 
                          appropriation be recommended for each year of the 2003-2005 
                          biennium at the approved budget level for the current 
                          (2002-2003) year and that any request exceeding that 
                          amount be reconsidered and set at the 2002-2003 fiscal 
                          year approved level. The inadvertent result is that 
                          the AGIO would not have an appropriation for positions 
                          in any budget, because DIS only appropriated for operational 
                          cost, assuming the position appropriations would be 
                          moved to the Office of Information Technology as planned.</p>
                        <p>The current AGIO operating appropriation is under the 
                          Department of Information Systems and the positions 
                          were moved to the Office of Information Technology prior 
                          to the beginning of the fiscal year. There are no positions 
                          listed with the appropriation listed with the Department 
                          of Information Systems.</p>
                        <p>The appropriation listed for GIS in Act 1499 (83rd 
                          General Assembly) is $1,307,980 but was not fully budgeted 
                          at the beginning of the 2003 fiscal year. It was instead 
                          budgeted for $459,243 in the following categories:</p>
                        <p> Regular Salaries - $0<br />
                          Extra Help - $10,280<br />
                          Personal Serv Match - $813<br />
                          Operating Expenses - $98,150<br />
                          Travel Conferences - $45,000<br />
                          Prof. Fees &amp; Serv. - $125,000<br />
                          Data Processing - $180,000<br />
                          <br />
                          The intention was to unblock any deferred appropriation 
                          as it was needed. That was the case as funding was received 
                          from the Department of Information Systems. Under the 
                          current adopted motion the AGIO budget will be $459,243 
                          as listed above with no salaries budgeted.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Finance and Administration is currently 
                          compiling a list of issues similar to the AGIO&#8217;s 
                          that are the inadvertent result of the 84th General 
                          Assembly adopted motion. The Department of Finance and 
                          Administration will request the 84th General Assembly 
                          Joint Budget Committee administratively review these 
                          inadvertent issues. Ultimately the AGIO will request 
                          that the salaries and operational cost appropriations 
                          are placed in one agency and funds are allocated to 
                          the Arkansas Geographic Information Systems Fund. </p>
                        <p>The AGIO is currently working with the Department of 
                          Finance and Administration to craft a letter detailing 
                          our current situation. The letter will then be sent 
                          from Carolyn to the Governor and from the Governor to 
                          the Department of Finance and Administration. The AGIO 
                          is also working with Nancy Turner, the Chief Financial 
                          Officer of the Department of Information Systems, and 
                          with our Department of Finance and Administration budget 
                          analyst to gain a better understanding of possible solutions. 
                          Currently the future of the AGIO is very uncertain. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The AGIO suggested that the ASLIB may wish to follow 
                          up with members of the 84th General Assembly Joint Budget 
                          Committee to educate them on the AGIO situation. Members 
                          of the ASLIB agreed that several phone calls should 
                          be made and requested a summary of the situation when 
                          it is made clearer to the AGIO.</p>
                        <h3>Appropriation Bills for Data Development</h3>
                        <p> Mr. Dalby proposed the ASLIB consider seeking general 
                          improvement funds from the 84th General Assembly to 
                          support the Arkansas Centerline File Program. The general 
                          improvement funds would be used to assist counties in 
                          creating centerlines, and the distribution of centerlines 
                          in the Arkansas Centerline File Standard format.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dalby went on to propose the ASLIB consider seeking 
                          general improvement funds from the 84th General Assembly 
                          to support a second aerial photography project. The 
                          project would be part of the Arkansas Digital Ortho 
                          Program and would be designed in a similar fashion (cooperative 
                          partnerships with the AGIO managing the project). This 
                          proposal was made as a result of a survey of past ADOP 
                          cooperators. Survey results indicated that cooperators 
                          would like to update the digital orthophotography in 
                          2004 and would be willing to contribute money to the 
                          program. The general improvement funds would serve as 
                          state &#8220;seed&#8221; money as well as provide money 
                          for the distribution of the orthos once they were created.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dalby went on to say that each of the general improvement 
                          requests would be beneficial to the state and that regardless 
                          of the level of funding, the appropriation would be 
                          needed in order to spend any potential money collected 
                          for either program.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Limp stated that a number of additional stakeholders 
                          may participate this time and the technological advances 
                          may lead us to acquire the orthos in a slightly different 
                          manner.</p>
                        <p>The AGIO suggested that the ASLIB not enter into a 
                          cooperative partnership with the USGS this time.</p>
                        <p>Shirley Sandlin moved to request the AGIO to prepare 
                          two proposed bills that request general improvement 
                          funds from the 84th General Assembly for the Arkansas 
                          Centerline File Program and the Arkansas Digital Otho 
                          Program. Suzanne Wiley seconded the motion. The motion 
                          passed unanimously.</p>
                        <h3> Update on GeoStor Operational Options</h3>
                        <p> Mr. Dalby provided the ASLIB with an overview of possible 
                          options for an operational GeoStor. The options were 
                          as follows (in no particular order):</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p> Move GeoStor to DIS</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Move GeoStor to a private entity</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Move GeoStor to an academia entity</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Convert to operational GeoStor at CAST</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Do nothing and &#8220;lose&#8221; GeoStor at the 
                              end of the state fiscal year</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After much discussion, Ms. Sandlin moved for the state 
                          to purchase licenses and convert GeoStor to an operational 
                          mode at CAST with support from the AGIO and direction 
                          from the ASLIB. Mr. Jones seconded the motion. The motion 
                          passed unanimously. Dr. Limp abstained from the vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dalby went on to explain that software license 
                          fees must be paid at the beginning of the state fiscal 
                          year (July 1, 2003) regardless of which &#8220;operational&#8221; 
                          option was chosen. He went on to say that the state 
                          should probably be the one to purchase the licenses.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jones then made a motion for the AGIO to investigate 
                          seeking general improvement funds from the 84th General 
                          Assembly to support GeoStor in an operational mode. 
                          Ms. Sandlin seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <h3> AGIO Funding Strategies</h3>
                        <p> Mr. Johnson briefed the ASLIB on the possibility of 
                          seeking a stable AGIO revenue source by placing a fee 
                          on all taxable ad valorem parcels each year. Mr. Johnson 
                          went on to explain that monies collected from the fee 
                          could be distributed on a percentage basis to the counties 
                          for information technology investments and to the Arkansas 
                          Geographic Information Systems Fund to support county 
                          GIS activity.<br />
                          Dr. Limp proposed a motion for the AGIO to move forward 
                          on drafting a proposed bill, identifying potential sponsors, 
                          and seeking the advice of the administration. Suzanne 
                          seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p> Mr. Smith requested a one page paper outlining talking 
                          points that reflect what the proposed bills&#8217; benefits 
                          would be to the counties and the AGIO.</p>
