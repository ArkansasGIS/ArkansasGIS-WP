                          Cromwell at 6:00pm. After review, Suzanne Wiley moved

                        <h3> Introduction of the Guests</h3>
                        <p> Shelby Johnson gave a brief introduction of Mark Coppersmith, 
                          USGS Coordination and Requirement Liaison, from the 
                          Mid-Continent Mapping Center in Rolla, Missouri and 
                          then turned the floor to Mark for further introductions. 
                          Mark formally introduced Bill Sneed, the new Mapping 
                          Partnership Office director to be stationed at the Little 
                          Rock Water Office of the USGS. Mark stated his enjoyment 
                          in working with the Board and working in Arkansas and 
                          that he would continue to be supportive of ongoing work 
                          here, but that his coordination role would lessen now 
                          as Bill would become the primary USGS contact point 
                          in the state. He commented this event would be the point 
                          at which he would no longer serve that official role 
                          and all coordination activities would rest with Bill. 
                          Mark then turned the floor to Bill. Bill introduced 
                          himself and gave a brief overview of his career track 
                          and the types of work he had performed during his tenure 
                          with USGS. He provided some details about getting relocated 
                          from Rolla, Missouri to Arkansas and that he would be 
                          building a home in Perry County. He concluded his introduction 
                          by stating his excitement to be in Arkansas and that 
                          he was looking forward to establishing the partnership 
                          office and directing the National Map partnership activities 
                          in the state. Board Chair Susan Cromwell recognized 
                          Mark for his past efforts and then welcomed Bill. Then 
                          it was suggested for all present to introduce themselves 
                          to Bill.</p>
                        <h3> Process for Loading Spatial Data into GeoStor and 
                          its Promulgation Status </h3>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson, State Geographic Information Coordinator, 
                          presented a review of the policy and then asked Learon 
                          Dalby, GIS Program Manager, to review the steps. Learon 
                          reviewed the data loading workflow for the Board and 
                          then referred the members to a list of specific data 
                          requests that was prepared according to the data loading 
                          policy established by the Board. Learon presented specific 
                          proposed load requests. For example, one set of data 
                          on the list included county road centerline files where 
                          they have achieved compliance with Arkansas Centerline 
                          File standard. Learon noted these files met the qualifications 
                          to merit loading and should be generally accessible 
                          for use by the GIS user community. Other data requested 
                          to load included: Arkansas Electric Cooperatives service 
                          boundaries, various counties including Cross County 
                          Assessor Mapping data, Health media coverage layers. 
                          (The Board was presented with a full list on the attached 
                          document.) Following a short discussion there was discussion 
                          on which agency or organization would be the data custodian. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Learon reviewed with the Board a prior Board decision 
                          to utilize the City of Van Buren, Arkansas and its GIS 
                          data as a pilot test for the development of a data loading 
                          policy. Learon reported that CAST is prepared to load 
                          the initial City of Van Buren dataset based on the decision 
                          from the Board. A discussion followed on Van Buren data 
                          pilot loading set quality control issues, data size 
                          and other issues. The question was raised about the 
                          establishment of fees to host local level data. AGIO 
                          staff reported no fee structure had been set and that 
                          a Van Buren cost was unknown. However, this will serve 
                          as model for fee determination. Bill Bush motioned to 
                          accept the recommendation to load Van Buren data; Randy 
                          Jones seconded the motion. Motion passed unanimously. 
                          Fred Limp rescued himself from the vote on the basis 
                          that the Board&#8217;s decision impacts the operation 
                          of GeoStor. A discussion followed on particular technical 
                          requirements for loading, dealing with data format, 
                          and other technical issues related to actually loading 
                          the data. Fred explained that all these issues are under 
                          development and that staff would prepare a technical 
                          document outlining the details for technical requirements 
                          and pass that documentation to the AGIO. Susan Cromwell 
                          voiced concern regarding a process for ongoing maintenance, 
                          and commitments by the custodians of the data, for the 
                          files that are uploaded into GeoStor.</p>
                        <h3> Update on GeoStor and GeoStor Operational Options</h3>
                        <p>Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) 
                          pilot to test direct connect to GeoStor. Shelby presented 
                          an update on interest and potential from ADEQ to subscribe 
                          to a service that would allow ADEQ users to connect 
                          directly to GeoStor. The test provided no conclusive 
                          results on the initial attempts at ADEQ. There are a 
                          variety of limiting factors, including client bandwidth 
                          at the ADEQ facility and other issues associated with 
                          how the GeoStor database is tuned. A follow-up test 
                          is necessary and Shelby told the Board this would be 
                          coordinated with ADEQ. </p>
                        <p>Shelby also presented a document detailing improvements 
                          to GeoStor. There was some discussion about data already 
                          loaded recently without applying the policy for data 
                          loading. Some of the notable changes to the GeoStor 
                          architecture in Version 3 include: ability to take advantage 
                          of distributed computing for the future based upon Linux 
                          operating system and distributed workstations sharing 
                          processing threads. With Version 3 transition, the most 
                          significant change for end users is that Metadata distribution 
                          will include metadata for the delivered file, not the 
                          source metadata e.g. datum, projection, and extent; 
                          which will resolve consistency issues.</p>
                        <p>Chris Boudreaux asked if the MrSid compression issue 
                          had been resolved. Learon Dalby explained the issue 
                          dealt with software licensing by LizardTech and an agreement 
                          could not be reached with them. Therefore, MrSid compression 
                          is not offered as a format in GeoStor. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley asked about the outcome of the Oracle 
                          video. Shelby reported briefly that Arkansas would be 
                          showcased by Oracle at their international conference 
                          with a video about GeoStor technology and how the state 
                          uses the Oracle database to serve GIS spatial data.

                          roles.</p>
                        <h3> Report from Arkansas Geographic Information Office 
                        </h3>
                        <p> Shelby introduced AGIO staff and asked them to provide 
                          highlights of the written reports.</p>
                        <h4> <em>Update on CAMP and Cadastral Standard</em></h4>
                        <p> Richie Pierce, Cadastral GIS Specialist, discussed 
                          highlights of the County Assessor Mapping Program and 
                          the Draft Cadastral Standard which was presented to 
                          the Board. Richie reported on county status. See doc 
                          for details. He will be presenting a detailed update 
                          of the program at the County Assessors conference later 
                          in the month. Shelby Johnson mentioned that AGIO had 
                          hosted Senior staff including, Debra Asbury, Director, 
                          Page Kutait, Deputy Director, and John Zimpel, all from 
                          the Assessment Coordination Department, to show them 
                          the resulting data. Assessor points are proving very 
                          useful for locating school districts by the school code 
                          associated through the Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal 
                          databases. Richie also reported on his work with the 
                          Arkansas Highway &amp; Transportation Department&#8217;s 
                          Highway 412 Bypass Project around Springdale, as a test 
                          case for use by AHTD in public notice mail-outs.</p>
                        <h4><em>Update on ACF Tool</em></h4>
                        <p> Vince Guillet reported on initial development and 
                          testing of the ACF Tool with Benton County, and additional 
                          improvements made to the tool following the beta tests. 
                          Counties that utilize the tool should see tremendous 
                          time and resource savings in maintaining ACF compliant 
                          centerline data.</p>
                        <h4><em>Update on Interest in Water Boundary Standard</em></h4>
                        <p> Learon Dalby reported on initial interest in a water 
                          utilities, waterline and water boundary GIS data standard. 
                          He stated the initial need for water data came through 
                          Rusty McAlister from Soil and Water. In a follow up, 
                          the AGIO planned to host a preliminary meeting with 
                          representatives from both private and public sectors 
                          and to establish a working group that would develop 
                          a standard for future Board approval for promulgation. 
                        </p>
                        <h4><em>Update on Regional National Map</em></h4>
                        <p> Learon Dalby reported on the progress of the USGS 
                          grant for National Map pilot project. Learon reported 
                          on specifics for the project. Future work will be coordinated 
                          with Bill Sneed. A general discussion on possibilities 
                          followed.</p>
                        <h4><em>Update on Homeland Security Grant</em></h4>
                        <p> Shelby report on proposals submitted to the Arkansas 
                          Department of Emergency Management. The proposals were 
                          not successful. Shelby reported one significant outcome 
                          was that both Carolyn Walton and Gary Underwood were 
                          now engaged in the state homeland security task force 
                          and that from a GIS perspective the next rounds of funding 
                          opportunities may be better. He also mentioned that 
                          all County Judges had been sent memos to encourage them 
                          to place GIS as a priority in their new county homeland 
                          security need assessment. Only the state of Indiana 
                          put funding into GIS during the last round of the grant 
                          program. Shelby also stated that NSGIC was putting forth 
                          a resolution for GIS in disaster recovery and emergency 
                          management to increase the potential of funding GIS 
                          related projects in support of homeland security.</p>
                        <h4><em>Update on FEMA and ASWCC</em></h4>
                        <p> Shelby reported on the FEMA activity related to the 
                          Flood Map Modernization Program being launched by FEMA. 
                          The AGIO prepared and submitted a proposal in response 
                          to AR Soil &amp; Water which manages the state floodplain 
                          program. FEMA is moving Flood Map Modernization into 
                          digital mapping. The draft proposed adding GIS specialist 
                          staff personnel at the AGIO for flood plain and elevation 
                          data coordination.</p>
                        <h4><em>SB697/GIS Interim Study and Funding Strategies 
                          (fees, taxes, etc.)</em></h4>
                        <p> Shelby reported that the Joint Committee on Advanced 
                          Communications and Information Technology (JCACIT) met 
                          and approved SB 697 as an interim study. He sent copies 
                          of the Interim Study proposed outline to various agencies, 
                          and has presented it to various groups with a request 
                          for specific comments. The County Judges Association 
                          requested that the AGIO keep David Morris appraised 
                          of the study progress.</p>
                        <h3> ADOP II &#8211; Project Discussion</h3>
                        <p>Shelby discussed interest by numerous stakeholders 
                          in new digital orhtophotography data. He stated several 
                          forest industry constituents voiced interest in new 
                          data. He reminded the Board of the General Improvement 
                          Fund Appropriation from ACT 1511 of 2003 and that existing 
                          appropriation was included but no funding was allocated. 
                          A mechanism is in place to potentially coordinate another 
                          statewide program. Shelby also commented that many utility 
                          industry constituents voiced interest as well. Staff 
                          within the AGIO have started looking at a funding model 
                          and researching costs. It was mentioned that elevation 
                          data should also be a priority. Shelby mentioned that 
                          these data are related. Good elevation data now would 
                          support improved image data quality in the future. A 
                          general discussion for a funding model ensued. Shelby 
                          talked about the survey sent out to participants in 
                          the previous program that was designed to gauge interest 
                          in ADOP II. Respondents indicated a positive response 
                          for the project and said that it should be updated in 
                          2004. Digital Globe satellite data was discussed as 
                          a possible source. Learon discussed various LIDAR solutions 
                          that might be used to generate accurate elevation data. 
                          Shelby requested that the Board direct AGIO to investigate 
                          this further. The motion was made and seconded. Following 
                          a brief discussion the motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <h3>Board Appointments</h3>
                        <p> Appointments for Chris, Shirley and Susan expired 
                          in August. Act 1250 provides that &#8220;with the exception 
                          of members representing a state agency, no person shall 
                          serve as a member of the board for more than two consecutive 
                          terms.&#8221; However, Chris, Shirley and Susan will 
                          serve until the governor processes new members. </p>
                        <h3> Other Business</h3>
                        <p> Fred Limp mentioned credit to the AGIO for recognition 
                          by industry leaders from outside of state.</p>
                        <p>Shirley Sandlin reported that the Assessment Coordination 
                          Department and AGIO received an award from ESRI recognizing 
                          the County Assessor Mapping Program.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell reported on her participation in the 
                          Open Data Consortium, which is talking about GIS program 
                          funding and sharing public business models for public 
                          data and GIS creation.</p>
                        <p>Learon Dalby reported on Amrut Khatri&#8217;s article 
                          about his work on GIS health data. He stated that the 
                          AGIO had been contacted by other agencies outside Arkansas 
                          seeking more information in order to copy the model 
                          of cooperation between AGIO and the health department. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Adjourn</h3>
                        <p>Following the conclusion of business, a motion was 
                          made by Phyllis Smith and seconded by Randy Jones to 
                          adjourn. The motion passed unanimously. The meeting 
                          adjourned at 8:10 pm.</p>
