                        <p> Shelby Johnson briefly reported on mapping work done 
                          with respect to the Department of Education School District 
                          reorganization. </p>
                        <h4> <em>Centerlines</em> </h4>
                        <p> Learon reported briefly on the AGIO participation 
                          at the County Judges meeting at AAC. The AGIO presentation 
                          was focused on the ACF project, and intended to spread 
                          awareness of the issues involved. The response seemed 
                          to be very favorable. A full ACF project progress report 
                          is available online.</p>
                        <h4> <em>Health and Critical Infrastructure Status</em></h4>
                        <p> Amrut Khatri reported briefly on project progress:</p>
                        <p> The hospital layer, spatial part, has been completed. 
                          Individual hospital loading dock locations are included. 
                          Heliport locations are included as well. The mapping 
                          of the local health units is almost done, except for 
                          Desha and Chicot counties. Inclusion of the individual 
                          ambulance locations has been requested, and possible 
                          solutions and problems regarding this request have been 
                          discussed. </p>
                        <p>A joint ACF and hospital mapping conference booth is 
                          planned for the upcoming County Judges conference.</p>
                        <h4> <em>Assessors Mapping &#8211; CAMP</em> </h4>
                        <p>Richie Pierce was not present so Learon Dalby gave 
                          a brief report on the CAMP project status.</p>
                        <p> A full CAMP project report is available on the Web 
                          as previously stated. Ten new counties have now been 
                          trained in the use of the mapping software. </p>
                        <p> Percent completed by county:</p>

                        <h4> <em>Workshops, Published Articles and Press Activity 
                          &#8211; County Judges Seminar</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reported on the work Leann Manning is 
                          doing with a new article. He briefly touched on a Web 
                          enabled satisfaction survey pertaining to AGIO and GeoStor 
                          customer/stakeholder performance. He also reported on 
                          the aforementioned County Judges meeting presentation.</p>
                        <h4><em>Update on GeoStor Development and Usage</em></h4>
                        <p> Fred Limp reported that there now have been approximately 
                          100,000 GeoStor downloads, which is equivalent to around 
                          1 million traditional downloads. A steady download increase 
                          is evident. The most commonly downloaded format is the 
                          DOQQ, NAD 83 UTM, and State Plane coordinate system. 
                          Additional Landsat imagery has been added, and County 
                          SURRGO soils data is prepared for 11 counties. For information 
                          on themes, please see report from CAST.</p>
                        <p> An issue Fred brought up was the AHTD aerial photos, 
                          about 20,000 &#8211; 30,000 photos exist. But these 
                          aerial photos are not digital ortho-photos meaning they 
                          have no rectification, this presents a challenge to 
                          load them into GeoStor where the present architecture 
                          requires a rectified photo. In lieu of this, CAST is 
                          investigating alternative techniques to make this data 
                          accessible for download. There is a need to explain 
                          the various formats to users, an educational effort, 
                          to emphasize that the photos are not rectified.</p>
                        <p> Fred reported on various GeoStor update issues:</p>
                        <p> Many of the GeoStor users have requested to see the 
                          data before they receive it. Presently this option does 
                          not exist. One possible solution would be a graphical 
                          interface, or map interface would be desirable, enabling 
                          browsing of the stored material. A need exists for a 
                          data listing or catalog that is a published document 
                          rather than the dynamic listing on-line. This catalog 
                          could be used to depict how the data appears and could 
                          contain basic metadata. This in turn might satisfy the 
                          request to see data before it is received.</p>
                        <p> Maintenance note: GeoStor will be down for maintenance 
                          for two days, a notice will be forthcoming. Disk control 
                          problems and a RAID control malfunction have been fixed.</p>
                        <p> Learon Dalby briefly discussed GeoStor user issues 
                          and reported receiving a number of user calls requesting 
                          similar needs to be able to preview the data before 
                          it is sent. In some cases users only needed to view 
                          the data rather than actually receive a copy.</p>
                        <p> Suzanne briefly spoke of enthusiasm from the State&#8217;s 
                          Aerial Applicators Association with regard to various 
                          mapping possibilities, and the associated GIS training 
                          needs. Susan briefly spoke of the needs librarians have 
                          to access, and retrieve GIS data.</p>
                        <p> Shelby introduced Mr. Bell, the Pulaski area GIS Director, 
                          and mentioned Mr. Bell&#8217;s experience of direct 
                          connections to GeoStor. Mr. Bell spoke on the test they 
                          conducted to directly connect from the PAGIS GIS system 
                          directly to the GeoStor database through the Internet. 
                          PAGIS and the Central Arkansas Water System have an 
                          increasing need for GIS data outside the existing City 
                          limits of Little Rock and North Little Rock. By accessing 
                          the data in GeoStor they can retrieve information in 
                          the remainder of Pulaski County as well as adjoining 
                          counties such as Perry, Saline, Faulkner and Lonoke 
                          Counties all of which are included in the planning area 
                          for the Water System future services.<br />
                          Shelby explained to the Board the meaning of direct 
                          connections to GeoStor.</p>
                        <p> Mr. Bell asked whether direct connections become a 
                          future regular service? What would the rates have to 
                          be? A discussion followed that talked about this kind 
                          of functionality being planned and included in the Business 
                          Model document that would be discussed late during the 
                          meeting.</p>
                        <h4> <em>Update on State Government Realignment, Funding 
                          Strategies (GeoStor Business Model Document), Emerging 
                          Technologies</em></h4>
                        <p>Mike McGibbony reported generally on the current state 
                          government restructuring effort, and specifically on 
                          the effect on DIS. He spoke of Senate bill 45, that 
                          amendments had been made, and the anticipation of some 
                          job loss within DIS. He also mentioned that the bill 
                          hopefully would pass within two weeks. </p>
                        <p>DIS will undergo a transfer of Type 2, meaning it is 
                          a partial transfer leaving the internal structure intact 
                          in the transfer. <br />
                          Mike spoke briefly of the DIS billing problem of 10 
                          million dollars, and that the issues yet were undecided.<br />
                          The issue of AGIO and GeoStor funding were discussed: 
                          Rates, etc. are established, if the AGIO and GeoStor 
                          stay within DIS. If funding will come from General Revenue, 
                          no billing will be necessary, however that case is very 
                          unlikely.</p>
                        <p>Mike touched on the effect the transfer will have on 
                          the performance based budgeting process.</p>
                        <p>Shelby commented on the result of that Transfer Type, 
                          2 would mean that the standards set by the Board would 
                          remain unaffected, the Board would remain intact, and 
                          operations such as GeoStor and the AGIO could continue.<br />
                          It was further stated that the ECIO will undergo a Type 
                          2 transfer, where all the power will remain intact. 
                          The question was raised how the ASLIB entity would transfer, 
                          if at all, and what transfer type it would have to be, 
                          because the ASLIB is not specifically referenced in 
                          the current edition of Senate Bill 45.</p>
                        <p>A general discussion ensued on this topic.</p>
                        <p>Bill Bush commented on the reorganization and meant 
                          that there is a time-delayed reorganization of boards, 
                          etc. The ASLIB is an independent board, with no fiscal 
                          responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Core infrastructure:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p> Budget proposition is still up in the air.</p>

                          <li>
                            <p> Will the statewide CIO IT realignment create advantages 
                              for the ASLIB and the AGIO?</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Funding:<br />
                          Mike McGibbony meant that private and public sector 
                          strategies must be pursued, and that DIS cannot cover 
                          the GeoStor cost. He further stated that DIS would only 
                          be able to bill GeoStor as a product, since DIS is governed 
                          by federal regulations.</p>
                        <p>A discussion arose on DIS billing and the AGIO fund. 
                          Should the appropriation language be changed? Should 
                          the act language change to fit the new organizational 
                          structure?</p>
                        <p>Mike McGibbony mentioned that a demonstration for Acxiom 
                          would be useful, for possible, future funding of GeoStor 
                          and to educate that company on the advantages of maintaining 
                          the system.</p>
                        <p>Fred Limp raised the issue of production software licensing 
                          needs, and the funding needed to make GeoStor operational 
                          and software license compliant (Oracle, etc.).</p>
                        <p>Relocation costs from CAST to an operational system 
                          at DIS were discussed, but these detailed costs are 
                          unknown.</p>
                        <p>The following possible GeoStor options were discussed, 
                          for the future, should funding cease:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p> Option 1: Subcontract with a major information 
                              technology company such as Acxiom for hosting GeoStor</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Option 2: Create an access fee structure for private 
                              industry funding, such as the timber industry, the 
                              utilities industry or engineering and surveying 
                              firms who are utilizing the system.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Option 3: Shut down GeoStor.</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell briefly spoke on policy changes with 
                          respect to DIS, and the possibility to achieve funding 
                          through General Revenue outside of DIS. She meant that 
                          we need to focus on value-added aspects first, and discuss 
                          the DIS issue later.</p>
                        <p>Shelby opened a general discussion of Real Estate Transfer 
                          Tax currently utilized to support a number of existing 
                          county and state programs. The transfer tax is the only 
                          revenue stream currently in place that closely connects 
                          with land information. The Board has discussed proposing 
                          possible increases in this tax, or possible reallocations 
                          of this tax, in the past, however no action has been 
                          taken and no recommendation issued.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell began the discussion of the Draft Business 
                          Model document which relates to the various ways in 
                          which the Board and the AGIO might raise revenue streams 
                          to support the Office and GeoStor. This draft document 
                          outlines a number of ways in which this could take place.</p>
                        <p>Several changes to be made to the document.</p>
                        <p>Private data catalog:<br />
                          Discussion of the possibility of storing metadata of 
                          other data outside GeoStor, in GeoStor. Perhaps GeoStor 
                          could act as a data portal, or perhaps a fee-based reseller 
                          scenario would be possible?</p>
                        <p>Issues:<br />
                          Priority data queue<br />
                          Hardware preferable<br />
                          Dedicated platform<br />
                          Direct connect, potential value (Mr. Bell)</p>
                        <p>AGIO should create a marketing brochure for these kinds 
                          of services.</p>
                        <p>Action item until next meeting: Rates must be developed 
                          for each proposed service outlined in the discussion.</p>
                        <p>Web map development:</p>
                        <p> Motion for all members of the Board and the AGIO, 
                          task until next meeting:<br />
                          Identify, and evaluate value-added applications with 
                          regard to webmap development and hosting, within each 
                          area.<br />
                          Emphasis should initially be given to applications intended 
                          to be hosted on GeoStor, and the GeoStor interface users 
                          should be defined. Explore possible map interface, for 
                          all users.</p>
                        <p>Board Policy Action<br />
                          Policy for Loading Spatial Data into GeoStor &#8211; 
                          revised policy sent this week</p>
                        <p>Fred Limp proposed revisions of the policy statement.</p>
                        <p>Shelby stated that the document would be presented 
                          again to the Board at the next meeting, for approval, 
                          before final promulgation.</p>
                        <p>MOTION: Suzanne Wiley motioned to accept the GeoStor
