                        <h3>Not Attending</h3>
                        <p> Mr. Jim Wells, Wellsco Graphics Solutions </p>
                        <h3>Special Representatives</h3>
                        <p> Mr. Shelby Johnson, State Land Information Coordinator<br />
                          Mr. Learon Dalby, GIS Specialist<br />
                          Mr. Mike Garner, Westark College</p>
                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order and the minutes of 
                          December 15, 2000, and of January 31, 2001, were approved.</p>
                        <h3>Report of the State Land Information Coordinator</h3>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson commented on the updated web pages and 
                          the new domain name of www.gis.state.ar.us, which will 
                          serve as a gateway to GIS information for the state. 
                          He also explained that Learon Dalby has created a web 
                          page that will allow members of the General Assembly 
                          to request custom maps based on their specific interests. 
                          He hopes this will be an educational tool to help legislators 
                          understand some of the practical uses of GIS.</p>
                        <p class="BOLDpreg10pt"><strong><em>NAPP</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby next explained that the flights are continuing 
                          as the weather allows. The contractor reports that of 
                          the original 50% of the state that remained to be covered, 
                          50% of that has been completed, leaving about one-quarter 
                          of the state left to fly. All of the QA/QC inspection 
                          has been returned from last year's flight and now the 
                          contractor knows which areas will require reflights 
                          and those will be done this year. </p>
                        <p class="BOLDpreg10pt"><strong><em>ADOP</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that an additional requirement has 
                          been added to the project as a deliverable is Mr. Sid 
                          compressed data. He said it was hard to decide on what 
                          compression ratio to utilize, so he thought the best 
                          thing to do would be to let the Board make the decision. 
                          He showed examples of file size versus quality. He said 
                          the contractor recommends 20:1 compression, which delivers 
                          excellent compression, but he thought the quality loss 
                          might not meet all needs. He asked the contractor to 
                          run tests at 15:1 and 10:1 and 5:1. Shelby explained 
                          that the whole state at no compression is between 450GB 
                          to 500GB. He showed examples of files at different compression 
                          ratios and asked the Board members for their feedback. 
                        </p>
                        <p>After a lengthy discussion of the best way to provide 
                          the data to users, the members recommended going for 
                          the lowest compression to get the best quality possible 
                          at 5:1 or 10:1, and possibly investigate whether or 
                          not Mr. Sid can recompress and what other states are 
                          using. It was also recommended that the full uncompressed 
                          files be available for users to acquire by coming on 
                          site and making CDs from the data. Shelby will check 
                          with the vendor about receiving three separate data 
                          sets of 5:1, 20:1 and then the USGS set.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley asked if Shelby knew how much of the 
                          NAPP was rejected in the QA/QC and Shelby estimated 
                          around 60 frames, which was very good. </p>
                        <p class="BOLDpreg10pt"><strong><em>Corps of Engineers 
                          River Project</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby announced that the entire Arkansas River photography 
                          project has been entirely reflown because the film from 
                          last year was rejected. The DEM and vector contours 
                          are in production, and the digital orthos based on the 
                          new flight are also in production. He hopes to have 
                          them delivered later in the spring. </p>
                        <p class="BOLDpreg10pt"><strong><em>GeoStor</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Fred Limp said that since the initiation of the system, 
                          there have been 2,014 data downloads. He explained that 
                          the downloads are organized by coordinate system, whether 
                          or not they were chopped out by polygon or by a bounding 
                          box, the formats that people are requesting, and the 
                          IP addresses of requestors. He pointed out that the 
                          most downloads from a single location have been made 
                          from addresses at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="BOLDpreg10pt"><strong><em>Parcel Project</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reminded the Board that all his information 
                          in his report regarding the proposed parcel project 
                          are educated guesses. He attempted to do estimates on 
                          the number of counties that have some mapping done and 
                          then what it would take to complete digitized parcel 
                          mapping for the state in terms of time and money. It 
                          would entail going back to deed research from the grantor/grantee 
                          books, finding the book and page, copying the deed or 
                          getting the full legal record, and then digitizing that 
                          information. He explained that he estimated it would 
                          take one hour per deed and invited the Board to discuss 
                          this and revise it if necessary. Shelby said that the 
                          larger parcels would be easier to map, using digital 
                          cues from photography and section maps, which would 
                          probably move faster. He estimated 10 per hour for urban 
                          parcels, mainly because there are already bigger and 
                          better maps. For rurban areas, he estimated 5 per hour. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby went on to explain that they figured a 50-week 
                          work year, which yields 200 weeks in a four-year cycle 
                          or 100 weeks in a two-year cycle. He assigned a fairly 
                          high wage per hour, which could be lowered, and then 
                          a hardware and software cost, travel costs, and estimates 
                          for urban aerial photography. He explained that the 
                          overhead costs were very rough and said that he just 
                          did not have time to put into research to come up with 
                          a reasonable overhead calculation. A rough estimate 
                          to complete digitized parcel mapping for Arkansas would 
                          be $35-40 million. </p>
                        <p>Shelby asked the Board to review his estimates and 
                          provide feedback in order to refine the project numbers. 
                          Susan Cromwell suggested that the Board also needs to 
                          address the possibility of a pilot project and how to 
                          get funding to do so.</p>
                        <h3>Old Business</h3>
                        <p>The status of SLIB legislative efforts were discussed. 
                          Senate bills 495 and 580 have been submitted by Senator 
                          Gullett and are scheduled to come before the Senate 
                          Technology and Legislative Affairs Committee very soon. 
                          HB 1534 and 1365 were briefly discussed.</p>
                        <p>Randy reported that plans were confirmed for the dinner 
                          with the Women's Caucus to be hosted by the SLIB and 
                          Carmie Henry, VP for Governmental Affairs, Arkansas 
                          Electric Cooperatives on February 26th. Shelby and Learon 
                          will give a presentation on SLIB activities. Board members 
                          were encouraged to attend. Seven members responded that 
                          they would be there.</p>
                        <h3>New Business</h3>
                        <p>New business was tabled until the next meeting.</p>
                        <h3>Future Meetings</h3>
                        <p>The next meeting was set for February 26. A tentative 
                          meeting was also set for March 21 and April 4. <br />
                          The meeting was adjourned and the Board was given a 
                          presentation by the Arkansas One-Call Association Director, 
                          Dale Enoch.<br />
