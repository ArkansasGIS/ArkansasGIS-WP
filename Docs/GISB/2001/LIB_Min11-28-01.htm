                        <p>=========================</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order. The minutes of the 
                          last meeting of October 9, 2001, were approved unanimously.</p>
                        <h3>GIS Infrastructure Funding</h3>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley announced to the Board that pursuant 
                          to the provisions of Act 1691 of 2001, the Governor 
                          has released funds for the statewide GIS infrastructure 
                          of $420,000. She thanked the members of the Board, Shelby 
                          Johnson, Kelly Boyd, and Doug Elkins of the Department 
                          of Information Systems for their work and support in 
                          getting the legislation passed and the funds released. 
                          She explained that this will allow GeoStor to continue 
                          in its development.</p>
                        <h3>Statement by the Governor&#146;s Technology Policy 
                          Advisor</h3>
                        <p>Suzanne next introduced Kelly Boyd, Governor&#146;s 
                          Technology Policy Advisor. Mr. Boyd spoke to the Board 
                          regarding the importance of the GIS infrastructure for 
                          the state. He explained that in appointing the Board 
                          members, much thought was given to what skills the members 
                          would bring to the Board. Mr. Boyd thanked the members 
                          for being willing to serve and said that Governor Huckabee 
                          sent his thanks as well. He talked about the shortage 
                          of funding for programs and challenged the Board and 
                          the Arkansas Geographic Information Office to seek additional 
                          revenue streams to assist in supporting valuable GIS 
                          projects for the state. He said that he and Governor 
                          Huckabee are very impressed with the good work that 
                          is being done. Mr. Boyd said that he and the Governor 
                          will work with the State CIO to ensure that the rest 
                          of the country becomes aware of the innovative GIS projects 
                          that are going on in Arkansas.</p>
                        <h3>Report of the Arkansas Geographic Information Coordinator</h3>
                        <h4><em>NAPP/NDOP Meeting</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson said that the National Digital Ortho 
                          Program and the National Aerial Photography Program 
                          steering committee meeting was hosted in Little Rock. 
                          These committees are made up of all the major federal 
                          agencies that support the NAPP and NDOP programs, including 
                          the USGS, Farm Services Agency, National Resource Conservation 
                          Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Farm Statistics 
                          Agency, FEMA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and 
                          the U.S. Forest Service, all primarily agencies of the 
                          Department of the Interior.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that part of the reason for hosting 
                          this meeting was for the committee to come and see what 
                          has been done with the digital ortho and GeoStor project 
                          in Arkansas. He said it was a very good meeting and 
                          that the federal agencies left with a new understanding 
                          of what is going on in Arkansas. He hopes that this 
                          will assist in finding federal funding for ongoing and 
                          future projects.</p>
                        <h4><em>Digital Cadastral Study </em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby recounted the 2001 legislation that directs 
                          the Arkansas Geographic Information Office to study 
                          issues surrounding the implementation of digital parcel 
                          records for the state. He said that the study is being 
                          combined with the federal I-Team Initiative by the Office 
                          of Management &amp; Budget, and that a Cadastral I-Team 
                          has been formed to create a business plan on critical 
                          layers that are needed at the state level. A meeting 
                          was held and representatives from the Assessment Coordination 
                          Office, various state agencies, assessors&#146; offices, 
                          and GIS consultants attended. There was discussion of 
                          standards for cadastral mapping and other issues. That 
                          group determined to conduct a statewide survey of all 
                          the county assessors to determine mapping status in 
                          those offices. The results will be reported at the next 
                          meeting on December 13. He pointed out that there are 
                          some assessor&#146;s offices who complete no mapping 
                          at all, so this raises questions about how to build 
                          a digital cadastre if there are no maps to begin with.</p>
                        <h4><em>School District Boundary Dataset for the State</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby explained that this is a project in response 
                          to the ruling handed down by Judge Kilgore that the 
                          school funding formula in the state is not adequate 
                          and is not equitable. Part of the Blue Ribbon Commission 
                          is a subcommittee called the Structure Subcommittee. 
                          Shelby outline how this subcommittee is looking at the 
                          structure of the school districts and one possible recommendation 
                          from them may be some sort of restructuring of the school 
                          districts. Shelby said they gave a presentation to the 
                          subcommittee and Senator Jim Argue to show how GIS techniques 
                          can be applied to restructuring those districts by looking 
                          at bus times and travel times and student population 
                          demographics. Shelby and Phyllis Smith were called back 
                          to give a second demonstration to show the poor quality 
                          of the current digital data that is available for school 
                          districts, which is based on the Bureau of Census Tiger 
                          files and the boundaries are somewhat inaccurate. </p>
                        <p>Shelby said that the Secretary of State&#146;s Office 
                          is now involved through their redistricting efforts 
                          because those school district boundaries form the boundaries 
                          for school board elections. Through a three-way effort, 
                          it appears that the Geographic Information Office will 
                          be providing some technical support to the Secretary 
                          of State&#146;s Office, so they can improve the boundaries. 
                          The Department of Education is working with the Secretary 
                          of State&#146;s Office to try to get the school district 
                          dataset improved. </p>
                        <p>Shelby said that another reason this issue is important 
                          is because school district boundaries form a taxing 
                          jurisdiction that is dealt with by the Public Service 
                          Commission. He added that his office is working to make 
                          sure the data is developed with good metadata documentation 
                          for eventually getting it loaded into GeoStor.</p>
                        <h4><em>GPS Standards</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby gave a recap of the process of getting 
                          the GPS Standards adopted as a Rule and Regulation by 
                          the Legislative Subcommittee of Administrative Rules 
                          and Regulations on November 15, 2001. He pointed out 
                          that these Standards must be reviewed in the future 
                          on a regular basis to reflect changes in technology. 
                        </p>
                        <h4><em>Arkansas Centerline File</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon talked about the I-Team that will be developing 
                          this project, which will be a large-scale street file 
                          of 10 meters or less. It turns out that there are many 
                          uses for a large-scale centerline street file. A meeting 
                          was held in September hosted by Arkansas One Call and 
                          a second meeting was held in October, where discussions 
                          were held regarding what would be needed in a centerline 
                          street file. A third meeting was held in November to 
                          refine a draft document, and from that meeting it was 
                          decided to do a couple of pilot projects. </p>
                        <p>These are the actions that need to be taken:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p> Take AHTD data and warp it to second generation 
                              DOQQs and add attributes to see how it will line

                            <p> GPS all the roads in two DOQQs, one in the Delta 
                              and one in the mountains</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Digitize the roads off the new DOQQ using heads-up 
                              digitizing methodologies</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Overlay Tiger on top of it to see how it falls 
                              in</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Explore ways of maintaining the vector and the 
                              attributes, which will be challenge</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Distribution of the updated files; place in GeoStor</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Put in mechanisms to ensure updating and maintenance</p>
                          </li>

                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Learon said that he hopes this project will be finished 
                          by early 2002, and added that the primary goal of the 
                          pilot study is to determine an efficient way to develop 
                          the centerline file and its attributes. He went on to 
                          explain that there are interesting federal activities 
                          that tie into the Arkansas centerline file, such as 
                          the Tiger modernization program. </p>
                        <p>Learon explained that the primary focus is the working 
                          document and once it get settled, then they&#146;ll 
                          have a good idea of how to develop the I-Team plan. 
                          He said that the membership of the I-Team is fairly 
                          broad and that they plan to expand it to include more 
                          local representation like 911 coordinators and city 
                          or county people. </p>
                        <h4><em>Arkansas Digital Orthophotography Project</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby gave a recap of the ADOP project up to 
                          the current time. He said that large portions of South 
                          Arkansas have been QC&#146;d, CDs are being burned, 
                          and DOQQs will be in the hands of all of the cooperators 
                          by December. He said that several horizontal accuracy 
                          assessments have resulted to be at five meters. The 
                          next area they want to check for accuracy will be in 
                          Northwest Arkansas. The horizontal accuracy results 
                          for each DOQQ will be placed on the AGIO web site. He 
                          said that he hopes to get assistance from some of the 
                          educational institutions to do some of the accuracy 
                          assessments. </p>
                        <p>Learon explained that 970 of the Arkansas DOQQs have 
                          been accepted by the USGS, and that 2,628 remain in 
                          production at Pixxures. He said that all of the DOQQs 
                          that have been sent so far have either been accepted 
                          or small areas that were bad are being reprocessed, 
                          and there doesn&#146;t seem to be any major problems. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Learon explained that there are some areas to be reflown 
                          to finish the project and January 15, 2002, is the flight 
                          time. All film will be QC&#146;d by the USGS prior to 
                          flight season so as to know exactly what needs to be 
                          reflown. Shelby Johnson added that Northwest Geomatics 
                          will do the flying with one of their fastest planes 
                          and that they plan to fly as much as possible during 
                          the first available window, and in order to get this 
                          project wrapped up, the plan is to get film directly 
                          to Jay Story to immediately QC it to check for rejected 
                          film. Shelby said that it will take one clear week to 
                          finish flying.</p>
                        <h4><em>GeoStor</em></h4>
                        <p>Fred Limp said that there have been over 14,000 datasets 
                          downloaded and the number seems to be doubling each 
                          quarter. He explained that because many files are merged 
                          together to make seamless coverage for the state, the 
                          number of downloads is potentially misleading. Fred 
                          said that there are about 350 datasets but that they 
                          actually reflect about what would be about 13,500 different 
                          data files. So the 14,000 dataset downloads multiplied 
                          by 10 would more accurately reflect a comparable usage 
                          number as compared to data file downloads from another 
                          source. </p>
                        <p>They have the 1990 black and white DOQQs. They are 
                          doing contrast and balancing to create seamless 1990 
                          statewide black and white DOQQs. CAST will be done in 
                          about two weeks with this work and it will be added 
                          to GeoStor. Fred explained that they&#146;ve set a limit 
                          to file downloads on raster data to 625MB, which is 
                          one CD in size. He went on to explain that of the top 
                          25 datasets being downloaded, DRGs are the number one 
                          download, and that data from the Arkansas Highway and 
                          Transportation Department are in the top downloads.</p>
                        <p>Fred said that they will add CIRs as they become available. 
                          These can be moved quickly into GeoStor after the project 
                          cooperators receive their copies.</p>
                        <p>Fred said next that with the help from FGDC, they are 
                          expanding the capacity of GeoStor in two directions. 
                          One is that GeoStor will become an OGC compliant web 
                          map server. This means that any OGC compliant web map 
                          application can connect directly to GeoStor without 
                          downloading. Fred said they will also be adding Feature 
                          Serving capacity with support from FGDC, which means 
                          that compliant clients such as ESRI can connect directly 
                          to GeoStor without downloading data. He said that these 
                          are technical capacities and will probably be available 
                          sometime in January or a little later. </p>
                        <p>Fred next explained that CAST has been contact by the 
                          State of New York Office of Technology and they are 
                          very interested in the GeoStor approach and architecture. 
                          He said that CAST is working with them to give them 
                          information, and he thinks New York will move to adopt 
                          the GeoStor architecture. Fred added that this is something 
                          of which everyone should be proud, that Arkansas is 
                          developing a system that New York and others are adopting.</p>
                        <p>The next thing Fred talked about was that the architecture 
                          designed into GeoStor was that it wasn&#146;t simply 
                          a data distribution system but is the enterprise architecture 
                          to which a variety of applications can connect. He said 
                          in that regard they will be making public an economic 
                          development information system that has been developed 
                          with USGS support and expands upon the work of DINA, 
                          the Economic Development Commission, and others. This 
                          system uses mapping approaches to provide economic development 
                          information around the state. The advantage is that 
                          it offers easy menu access to users for the data.</p>
                        <h4><em>RAPID</em></h4>
                        <p>Fred Limp next talked about the RAPID project and explained 
                          that 450 datasets have been downloaded from GeoStor. 
                          He said that AmericaView is interested in having states 
                          participate and that it would be appropriate for the 
                          Arkansas Geographic Information Office, acting as the 
                          representative of the LIB, to formally participate in 
                          the AmericanView program. Fred explained that formal 
                          participation would mean a dramatic lowering of price 
                          for the acquisition of satellite imagery, from $600 
                          per scene to approximately half of that. He also pointed 
                          out that satellite imagery would be available within 
                          hours of acquisition instead of within weeks or months 
                          of its acquisition. </p>
                        <p>Fred explained that it would need to be determined 
                          as to who wants data and how much do they want, and 
                          how many participants there would be. He described that 
                          a statewide image acquisition would be about $3800 and 
                          this would be much cheaper if it was split between cooperators. 
                          Fred said that the AmericaView group is meeting in Cleveland 
                          on January 26th, 2002, and if the LIB has a plan in 
                          place by then it would be appropriate to talk to them 
                          at that point.</p>
                        <p>One last comment Fred made was that Landsat 5 and MODUS 
                          data would be available through AmericaView program, 
                          and that there are two new satellites (Hyperion and 
                          the Advanced Land Imager) that would also be available. 
                          The MODUS is the replacement for the Advanced Very High 
                          Resolution Radiometry (AVHRR), 250 meter data that is 
                          good for regional mapping and frequent changes. Hyperion 
                          is a hyperspectral sensor which is 30 meter on the ground 
                          and around 250 spectral bands. The Advanced Land Imager 
                          is very much like the current Landsat systems but improved 
                          in quality and does automatic atmospheric corrections 
                          as the images are acquired. Fred explained that the 
                          Hyperion and Advanced Land Imager acquisitions would 
                          be more expensive at $2000 per scene.</p>
                        <p>Fred recommended that the LIB determine what level 
                          of interest there is around the state. He said that 
                          to enter into an agreement with AmericaView, the purchase 
                          of one scene is required at $380, but that with more 
                          cooperators everyone could get more information at a 
                          lower cost and quicker processing time than by using 
                          traditional approaches.</p>
                        <h4><em>National Map</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that the National Mapping Project 
                          is the federal effort to get all of the USGS data online. 
                          What is being proposed is being able to get changes 
                          updated on-line within seven days. Suzanne explained 
                          that they are looking at GeoStor technology to achieve 
                          this and have met with Fred Limp to talk about this. 
                        </p>
                        <h4><em>Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson has been working with AHTD regarding 
                          the possibility of having them link to GeoStor and do 
                          editing directly in the GeoStor database. He explained 
                          that this could also relate directly to the Centerline 
                          project.</p>
                        <h4><em>GIS Conference</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that the GIS Users Conference from 
                          October 9 to 11 was extremely successful. Phyllis Smith 
                          explained that this was the 10th year anniversary and 
                          that there were approximately 225 attendees. She said 
                          the preconference workshop were very well attended by 
                          125 people, and that 12 vendors participated. Phyllis 
                          said that the breakout sessions were very good and that 
                          several subcommittees were formed. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that they held a RAPID coordination 
                          meeting and Bruce Gorham gave a presentation to about 
                          15 people. She said there was also an I-Team coordination 
                          meeting with Ron Matzner of FGDC and OMB, and there 
                          was discussion regarding federal funding. </p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson added that at the last NSGIC meeting 
                          that he was elected to the board, and that the board 
                          has designated Shelby, Stu Kirkpatrick from Montana, 
                          and Bill Burgess from Maryland be representatives to 
                          NSGIC to FGDC, OMB, and Ron Matzner with the I-Team 
                          initiative. Shelby said that there may be some funding 
                          for I-Team initiatives, get the business plans written, 
                          and pull the states together to work on hot topics. 
                          He further explained that these efforts will dovetail 
                          with the Federal One Stop project by Homeland Security 
                          and FGDC. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that there was an Education Panel 
                          at the GIS Users Conference and they received a lot 
                          of feedback from across the state on GPS remote sensing 
                          education. She said that out of that feedback came the 
                          creation of a GIS certification subcommittee that Mark 
                          Warner and Bob Weih agreed to co-chair. They will work 
                          on getting some more subcommittee members and will report 
                          to the LIB on their progress on exploring how to do 
                          GPS certification and who will be required to have certification.</p>
                        <h4><em>Committee Reports</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that several LIB committees tried 
                          to meet at the GIS Users Conference. The Electronic 
                          Plat Filing and Parcel Mapping Committee met and Randy 
                          Jones passed out their report to the Board. Randy said 
                          that there was debate regarding the intellectual property 
                          of surveys. He explained that a professional surveyor 
                          is required to file a copy of the plat in the circuit 
                          clerk&#146;s office in the county in which it was performed, 
                          and they file a copy of the plat in the State Surveyor&#146;s 
                          Office. Randy said that over the last few years, there 
                          has been a lot of talk about electronic plat filing 
                          and how that might simplify the filing process and how 
                          it might support the public in access of that information. 
                          He said that surveyors feel that some of the information 
                          is proprietary to the owner of the property and the 
                          surveyor, which has to be worked out. Randy explained 
                          that although the information is of public nature, being 
                          recorded in the courthouse and the State Surveyor&#146;s 
                          Office, a lot of the discussion revolves around the 
                          ease of access to the public that would be made through 
                          the internet. </p>
                        <p>Randy said that the ASPS has a committee that is working 
                          on the surveyors&#146; side of the electronic plat filing 
                          issues. He said he will speak at the next meeting in 
                          December and that hopefully the surveyors can be brought 
                          on board to take the lead in getting the pilot project 
                          going. </p>
                        <p>Kelly Boyd commented that Governor Huckabee is following 
                          this very closely and is extremely supportive. He asked 
                          that the Board keep him advised of what the Governor&#146;s 
                          Office can do to help in this project. </p>
                        <h3>OLD BUSINESS</h3>
                        <h4><em>Board Appointments</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that the final Board appointment 
                          had been issued. She noted that some Board members were 
                          appointed for one year. She explained that the one-year 
                          appointments are state agency representatives and that 
                          they can be reappointed more than twice in a row; the 
                          other members can only serve two consecutive terms and 
                          must take a break before serving again. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne reminded the members that elections need to 
                          take place and will be scheduled for the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>SmartMoves Awards</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reminded the Board that an application 
                          for this award was submitted in June. She explained 
                          that GeoStor and the ADOP program were submitted as 
                          projects that fit the requirements of the award. Suzanne 
                          said she has not yet received a response regarding this 
                          award.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne pointed out that INA now has an E-government 
                          web site and that it would be a good place to publicize 
                          the GeoStor rollout early next year.</p>
                        <h4><em>I-Teams</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reviewed the national I-Team effort and 
                          explained that it is a federal national effort to coordinate 
                          the development especially the seven basic framework 
                          layers of data state-by-state, as well as having each 
                          state identify special layers. She said that members 
                          are needed to be on subcommittees for the various layers 
                          of data for Arkansas, which are tentatively identified 
                          as ortho-imagery, transportation, elevation, hydrology, 
                          geodetic control, public land survey system, cadastral, 
                          government units, land use/land cover, street centerlines, 
                          soils, geology, telecommunications, critical infrastructure, 
                          and census. She explained that some chairs have been 
                          filled but that more are needed. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne explained that the cadastral and street centerlines 
                          subcommittees will be doing a lot in the next few months, 
                          but that the other subcommittees will need to be evaluating 
                          what kind of data is needed, what is already available, 
                          who should be the custodian, where do funds come from 
                          currently to support layers, and where might funds come 
                          from to support layers. The results will be necessary 
                          to complete an I-Team plan for Arkansas and eventually 
                          submit for consideration of federal funding. She said 
                          that it is likely that there will be some money available 
                          for the first states to get their requests filed.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne said Ron Matzner will be looking for funding 
                          from the FGDC to fund Arkansas representatives to attend 
                          MAGIC in Kansas City in April 2002. This would be for 
                          the purpose of looking at standards for the seven data 
                          layers. </p>
                        <h3>NEW BUSINESS</h3>
                        <h4><em>RAPID Coordination</em></h4>
                        <p>Fred Limp proposed the creation of an Arkansas AmericaView 
                          open consortium, which would be a holding structure 
                          for participants and which the Arkansas Geographic Information 
                          Office would help coordinate. He explained that once 
                          that was done, then it would need to be decided what 
                          should obtained through the consortium&#146;s activities, 
                          such as scenes, season, etc. </p>
                        <p>Fred next commented that if this entity is created, 
                          it would be in a better position to negotiate and interact 
                          with the national AmericaView program. He said he understood 
                          that there is an appropriation in Congress for $40M 
                          for the next four years to the USGS for AmericaView. 
                          Fred explained that it would have to be decided at what 
                          level the consortium would participate and then what 
                          the rules of participation would be. He said that participation 
                          would guarantee that a member who participated in the 
                          initial purchase could also get other data at a great 
                          discount. He recommended that the consortium would purchase 
                          one statewide coverage at about $3800 and that this 
                          would be divided amongst participants.</p>
                        <p>Bill Bush made the motion to create an Arkansas AmericaView 
                          Consortium through the Land Information Board. Shirley 
                          Sandlin seconded the motion and it was passed unanimously. 
                          It was requested that the Arkansas Geographic Information 
                          Office get out information to potential members and 
                          find out the type and quantity of imagery they would 
                          want to purchase the AmericaView will be meeting in 
                          January, and it was agreed that the LIB needs to send 
                          a letter saying that the Board wishes o be a participant 
                          in the program.</p>
                        <h4><em>Priorities for 2002 Suzanne Wiley recapped the

                          </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Suzanne asked the Board and Advisory Panel members 
                          for suggestions of what the Board should focus on in 
                          2002. Shelby Johnson introduced Mr. Yancey Reynolds 
                          of Reynolds Real Estate, who thanked the Board for their 
                          work. He then discussed challenges facing assessor&#146;s 
                          offices that do not have computers, and he explained 
                          that most assessor&#146;s offices are not standardized 
                          in terms of databases. He stressed that these are important 
                          issues that must be approached in the future. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne then listed the following goals for the coming 
                          year:</p>

                        </ol>
                        <h3>Next Meetings</h3>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley recommended that even though the members 
                          do not wish to meet in December, that it is important 
                          that work continue by email communication on the I-Team 
                          plan. The next meeting was scheduled on January 9th, 
                          which will also have a videoconference link with a location 
                          in Fayetteville.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
