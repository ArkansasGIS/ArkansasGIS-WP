                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p> The meeting was called to order in the Union Plaza 
                          Building 17th Floor Conference Room. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley welcomed the Advisory Panel members who 
                          were attending.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report of the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p><b><em>NAPP / DOQQs</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that processing of the files 
                          for the ADOP project is proceeding in MrSid and TIF 
                          format. Portions of several more counties have been 
                          processed and are being reviewed. Some additional hardware 
                          has been acquired to facilitate and streamline the review 
                          of data. Accuracy assessment testing is also being done 
                          for quality of the data against the old DOQs, as well 
                          as field testing.</p>
                        <p>Shelby reminded everyone that the web site is kept 
                          current as to the progress of the project.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Corps of Engineers River Project</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby said that the high resolution data is due to 
                          arrive at the end of June.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Meetings</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that he had an opportunity to speak 
                          to the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Engineers Conference. 
                          He said that he plans to attend the County Judge&#146;s 
                          Conference later in June, and Learon Dalby will attend 
                          the Arkansas Assessor&#146;s Association Conference 
                          in Springdale. </p>
                        <h3>Old Business</h3>
                        <p><b><em>GeoStor</em></b></p>
                        <p>Bob Harris from CAST explained that GeoStor downloads 
                          are averaging 1000 a month. He said that CAST has a 
                          new server in place and it is being upgraded with new 
                          software releases. Bob pointed out that vector data 
                          is loaded and is downloading much faster. Raster data 
                          development is in high gear and is being loaded on the 
                          server. Bob said that this data will be available later 
                          in June.</p>
                        <h4><b><em>Approval of Meeting Minutes</em></b></h4>
                        <p>The minutes from May 9, 2001, were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <p><b><em>GPS Standards</em></b></p>
                        <p>Learon Dalby described that the subcommittee that was 
                          formed at the last LIB meeting (Randy Jones, Tracy Ford, 
                          Dr. Medley, and Mike Daniels) corresponded by email 
                          and by phone. Learon said that they put a working document 
                          together and he handed out copies to the members.</p>
                        <p><b><em>GeoStor Metadata Standards</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that working on the metadata 
                          standards had to be shelved temporarily due to deadlines 
                          of a NASA proposal, but that he will get back to it 
                          as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p><b><em>AmericaView</em></b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that the USGS approved the 
                          proposal to help on the funding for the purchase of 
                          one scene for the initial test and the first run. Bob 
                          Harris said that a test was run the previous week of 
                          the connection between the EROS laboratory in South 
                          Dakota and the new CAST server. Everything ran correctly, 
                          and they are working on the processing of the data. 
                          Bob explained that they are setting up automated processes 
                          to sense the data arriving and to automate georeferencing 
                          the data to go to GeoStor. Bob added that they are going 
                          to try to obtain all three scenes in Path 24, covering 
                          the center of the state from north to south, and he 
                          commented that the USGS seemed enthusiastic about the 
                          project. Bob also said that the data will be made available 
                          for the public and input will be welcomed as to the 
                          usefulness of the data.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley pointed out that this may be a good opportunity 
                          to help users across the state with access to current 
                          data and that it might worth considering group purchases 
                          of data. </p>
                        <p><b><em>SmartMoves</em></b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley suggested that two proposals be considered 
                          for submission to the Governor&#146;s SmartMoves awards 
                          program: the GeoStor project and the ADOP project. Suzanne 
                          explained that receipt of a SmartMoves award includes 
                          increasing awareness of innovative programs, the agency 
                          and description of initiatives are feature on its web 
                          site, and press releases are issued at the state and 
                          national level describing the winning agency initiatives. 
                          After discussion, it was agreed that the two proposals 
                          be combined and that they would be turned in by next 
                          month.</p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson said that he would be at the next INA 
                          Board meeting and would make an effort to educate the 
                          Board regarding the proposal. </p>
                        <h3>New Business</h3>
                        <h4><b><em>Election of Officers</em></b></h4>
                        <p>After discussion, it was agreed that the election of 
                          new officers be postponed until the process of reappointments 
                          of members be completed. Phyllis moved to adopt this 
                          postponement, Susan Cromwell seconded the motion, and 
                          the Board unanimously approved postponing the selection 
                          of officers.</p>
                        <h4><b><em>State Chief Information Officer</em></b></h4>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell explained that at this point in time, 
                          the job description for the new state CIO position had 
                          been posted. The CIO Oversight Committee was to be appointed 
                          by the Governor, but there was no word regarding the 
                          appointees yet.</p>
                        <h4><b><em>Presentation of I-Team Initiatives</em></b></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson introduced Mr. Ron Matzner, who is serving 
                          as lead consultant for the FGDC and Federal Office of 
                          Management and Budget&#146;s I-Team initiative. Mr. 
                          Matzner explained that the I-Team Initiative is aimed 
                          at leveraging money and working in partnership to share 
                          data and pool investments, something that the Board 
                          has already been working towards regarding state GIS 
                          projects. Mr. Matzner covered much information, including 
                          the structure of I-Team planning, development of standards, 
                          developing federal partnerships, financing solutions 
                          teams, technical advisory groups, the current active 
                          teams, and new teams being formed.</p>
                        <h4><b><em>GPS Standards</em></b></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby revisited the topic of GPS Standards. 
                          He outlined the major changes that were recommended 
                          by the subcommittee:</p>

                            <p> In the title, the word &#147;standards&#148; was

                            <p> This will be considered a working document towards 
                              collecting mapping grade GPS data</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> The document will continue to be developed in 
                              depth in the future</p>
                          </li>

                            <p> An acknowledgment section will be added at the

                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>Some sections were moved to the Appendix</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There was discussion as to whether the document will 
                          move eventually from suggested standards to full standards 
                          for GPS data in the future. It was also suggested that 
                          the document be promoted to educational facilities that 
                          are teaching GPS. Learon explained that the document 
                          needs more research and filling out of some of the sections, 
                          as well as more public review. He suggested that the 
                          subcommittee might be expanded to get more input to 
                          the document. It was also suggested in discussion that 
                          it was important to stress metadata standards in relation 
                          to the purpose of the GPS standards.</p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson recommended that the edits and changes 
                          be made to the document, that the document be maintained 
                          in a draft form until the LIB meets again, and then 
                          have the Board plan to close out the review period and 
                          formalize the document. The members agreed to do this.</p>
                        <h3><b>Future Meetings</b></h3>
                        <p>It was decided to not meet in July. A meeting date 
                          was set for August 29th. </p>
                        <p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>
