                        <p> The meeting was called to order in the Ragland Building 
                          2nd Floor Conference Room. </p>
                        <p>The minutes from June 6, 2001, were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <h3>Report of the State Geographic Information Coordinator</h3>
                        <h4><em>Annual Report</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby advised the Board that the Arkansas Geographic 
                          Information Office has released an Annual Report which 
                          covers the activities of the past year. This <a href="http://www.gis.state.ar.us/Downloads/Documents/fy01.pdf">report</a> 
                          is available in .pdf format on the AGIO web site.</p>
                        <h4><em>AmericaView</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the RAPID project was 
                          moving forward. This is the process of moving satellite 
                          images from the EROS data center to CAST for autoprocessing 
                          and web presentation and web presentation in less than 
                          24 hours of satellite acquisition.. This will get essential 
                          data out to the community very quickly as compared to 
                          current processes. Shelby explained that he had attended 
                          an AmericaView conference recently and that Arkansas 
                          is currently the number one state in regards to the 
                          quality of the GeoStor architecture. He said that on 
                          September 18th CAST would be testing some new processes 
                          which may move the time down to six hours.</p>
                        <p>Shelby talked about the AmericaView conference and 
                          explained that there is a wish to increase education 
                          about the initiative. He said that for Arkansas it will 
                          be necessary to figure out how to fund the acquisition 
                          of this satellite data, perhaps with a standing order 
                          with the EROS center and cooperators to pay for the 
                          images. He informed the group that he would be meeting 
                          with the Cooperative Extension Service and members of 
                          the agricultural community who are very interested in 
                          the project.</p>
                        <h4><em>I-Team Initiative</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby announced that the I-Team Initiative for Arkansas 
                          would get a kickoff at the upcoming GIS Users Forum 
                          Conference in October. He explained that a business 
                          plan needs to be developed for data layers and the possiiblity 
                          of obtaining some Federal funding needs to be explored.</p>
                        <h4><em>Senate Resolution 22</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson updated the Board on the status of the 
                          appointment of members for the committee that will be 
                          studying electronic plat filing for the state. He said 
                          that no one has been appointed yet, but that it might 
                          be a feasible for the Board to form a subcommittee to 
                          make recommendations for those appointments.</p>
                        <h4><em>Bureau of Land Management</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby next talked about how the Bureau of Land Management 
                          is taking the initiative in regards to the development 
                          of a cadastral framework layer for the United States. 
                          They have done this in Western states and would like 
                          to see the Eastern states gather data. Arkansas is on 
                          the list as a pilot state for 2002 funding, along with 
                          North Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, and others.</p>
                        <h4><em>State Chief Information Officer</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby updated the Board on the status of the recruitment 
                          of the State CIO. He explained that the process was 
                          down to eight applicants who will be interviewed, of 
                          which three will be chosen to pass along to the Governoer 
                          for final consideration. The plan is to make an announcement 
                          in mid-September. The Board discussed the possibility 
                          of hosting an introduction meeting with the new CIO.</p>
                        <h4><em>USGS</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby informed the Board that Ray Fox of the USGS 
                          had visited to introduce the new Arkansas representative, 
                          Mark Coppersmith, who will also represent Kansas and 
                          Iowa. Mark will also attend the GIS Users Forum meeting.</p>
                        <h4><em>NAPP / DOQQ</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby went over the flight status for next season 
                          in which the areas that have not been flown will be 
                          covered and the NAPP rejected areas will be reflown. 
                          Flights are projects to begin on January 15th, 2002. 
                          He explained that cooperators in the project who have 
                          received CDs are very pleased with the quality. </p>
                        <p>Accuracy assessments are being carried out on the data 
                          and the results are very good. Learon explained that 
                          he will be giving demonstrations at the upcoming GIS 
                          Users Forum Conference in October on how to do accuracy 
                          assessments following the NSSDA.</p>
                        <h4><em>Corps of Engineers River Project</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon said that the only update on this project is 
                          that it is 80% complete. The LIDAR data is all in and 
                          the Corps of Engineers has that data. DOQQs are not 
                          in-house yet but a number are complete. The Corps decided 
                          to wait until some formatting issues are worked out 
                          by the vendor. </p>
                        <h3>Special Business</h3>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley introduced Senator Brenda Gullett, who 
                          expressed her support of the efforts of the Board. Discussion 
                          followed regarding the appropriation bill and ways to 
                          lobby the Governor's Office for funding.</p>
                        <h3>Old Business</h3>
                        <h4><em>GeoStor</em></h4>
                        <p>Fred Limp discussed the status of GeoStor, pointing 
                          out that user hits had increased to approximately 2000 
                          per month. He explained that raster data is now being 
                          downloaded and that 200 downloads had been made of the 
                          RAPID data sets, which is the LandSat 7 data. He noted 
                          that some of the top data sets are Arkansas Highway 
                          and Transportation data and added that it may be possible 
                          to automatically update GeoStor from the AHTD database.</p>
                        <p>Fred said that he will be meeting with representatives 
                          from USGS regarding the national map project and moving 
                          to an electronic approach. They are looking at updating 
                          changes in seven days, are looking at a system like 
                          GeoStor, and are interested in having state level data 
                          automatically update federal-level data. Fred is hoping 
                          to enter into an agreement with the USGS to let Arkansas 
                          be the first state in the national map pilot project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Fred explained that the next major update for GeoStor 
                          will be the '90s DOQQs, which will be in soon. 2000-2001 
                          DOQQs will not be added until there are more resources 
                          available as funding ended in July. He said thatCAST 
                          just completed a 1999 agriculture land use product for 
                          the entire state which contains three seasons, agriculture 
                          inventories, pastures, etc., and is very accurate. That 
                          data will be in GeoStor very soon and Soil and Water 
                          is supporting this. </p>
                        <p>Next he described an FGDC grant that was received to 
                          develop an on-line economic development mapping system. 
                          For all communities of over 5,000 people, CAST has created 
                          maps of commuter sheds of 30 and 60 minutes. Another 
                          project has been the population of the American Economic 
                          Development Association's Standard Economic Development 
                          Data Matrix by using GIS datasets from GeoStor and other 
                          sources. Fred explained that this group is collecting 
                          data elements from communities and this relates to the 
                          commuter shed data, DINA, and other sources. He commented 
                          that there will be about 220 major datasets that will 
                          be put into GeoStor and that FGDC is funding this effort. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Fred said that CAST has received a grant from FGDC 
                          to add web mapping and web service functions to GeoStor, 
                          which will provide increased funcationality.</p>
                        <p>Fred discussed the RAPID project and said that there 
                          has been a great response. There will be another test 
                          on September 18th, weather permitting, and they are 
                          aiming at a six-hour turnaround following satellite 
                          acquisition. He said that it is important now to find 
                          out whether the community needs data, when do they need 
                          data, what kind of data they need, etc. Fred explained 
                          that USGS has said that sometime in November or December 
                          they will want to formalize some kind of agreement and 
                          it will be necessary to decide what kind of relationship 
                          the state users wish to create. </p>
                        <p>Fred emphasized that further funding for GeoStor is 
                          becoming critical at this point or he could lose the 
                          GeoStor team. Discussion followed regarding funding 
                          possibilities. Shirley Sandlin made a motion that the 
                          Board pursue developing a collaborative effort to support 
                          the RAPID AmericaView acquisition of LandSat data. The 
                          motion was seconded by Jim Wells and was passed unanimously.</p>
                        <h4><em>GeoBEAR Project</em></h4>
                        <p>Fred Limp discussed the Geographic Baseline Environmental 
                          Assessment Reporting system, which was a proposal to 
                          NASA for $600,000 for two years. This would be the creation 
                          of a web-based system so that a user can draw a potential 
                          project boundary on a map and they would get back a 
                          report of environmental information such as wetlands, 
                          hydric soils, endangered species, archeological sites, 
                          etc., that meet federal mandates. Fred explained that 
                          CAST and Shelby Johnson worked closely with twelve collaborators 
                          to develop the proposal. They have not heard back and 
                          Fred said he does not expect to be funded during this 
                          cycle, but there is some interest in proceeding locally. 
                        </p>
                        <h4><em>GIS Users Forum Conference</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reminded the Board of the GIS Users Forum 
                          Conference starting on October 10th and encouraged all 
                          to attend. After some discussion it was decided that 
                          the next Board meeting will be held on the evening of 
                          October 9th, the night prior to the Conference and following 
                          the pre-conference workshops. Phyllis Smith explained 
                          that Secretary of State Sharon Priest will speak twice; 
                          Shelby Johnson, the State Geographic Information Coordinator, 
                          will speak on Wednesday; and Ron Matzner will speak 
                          to the Forum on Thursday regarding the I-Team Initiative. 
                        </p>
                        <h4><em>Board Appointments</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley informed the members that it is not sure 
                          at this point what the terms will be for current members. 
                          She explained that Steve Gunthrop of the Governor's 
                          office has taken over the effort to sort out board terms 
                          and appointments, and that the members will need to 
                          just wait and see what is decided. In the meantime, 
                          everyone will serve until replaced or reappointed.</p>
                        <h4><em>GPS Standards</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby reviewed changes in the GPS Standards 
                          document. He explained that to follow Arkansas Code, 
                          the LIB will need to approve the document in its final 
                          form and there will need to be a 30-day period of comment 
                          and review. After that period of review, a questionnaire 
                          form and a financial impact statement must be submitted 
                          to the Bureau of Legislative Research. They review the 
                          documentation and it is eventually forwarded to the 
                          Secretary of State's Office and State Library for review. 
                          Ultimately it goes before the Arkansas Legislative Council, 
                          which makes a decision whether this will become a Rule 
                          and gain official status. Learon pointed out that sometime 
                          in mid-October it would actually become a Rule if everything 
                          falls into place.</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell made the motion that the Board adopt 
                          the GPS Standards Version 3 and proceed with the Rules 
                          and Regulations process. Shirley Sandlin seconded the 
                          motion, a vote was taken, and the motion was unanimously 
                          approved.</p>
                        <h4><em>GeoStor Metadata Standards</em></h4>
                        <p>Learon Dalby explained that progress on Metadata Standards 
                          has been held up because of other GeoStor issues. Shelby 
                          Johnson said that these standards will be revisited 
                          soon. </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley commented that it is important for the 
                          ASDI Policies Committee of the Board to begin to meet 
                          to develop recommendations. She pointed out that the 
                          Electronic Plat Filing and Parcel Mapping Committee 
                          needs to meet, and the Strategic Planning Committee 
                          needs to meet before the Board can move ahead with regards 
                          to the I-Team Initiative. She said that the Communications 
                          and Public Relations Committee needs to get to work 
                          promoting the Board's efforts and the Funding Committee 
                          really needs to come up with some ideas. Suzanne encouraged 
                          all the subcommittees to meet as soon as practical and 
                          move ahead with their areas of interest.</p>
                        <h4><em>SmartMoves</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that she has had no response regarding 
                          the Governor's SmartMoves. However, a response from 
                          Robert Chandler of INA indicated that the INA Board 
                          was waiting until the State CIO was in place, but that 
                          it might be time to move ahead with awards as there 
                          had been several nomimations filed recently. Suzanne 
                          asked Shelby to go ahead and get in on the INA Board 
                          meeting to do a presentation about GeoStor.</p>
                        <h3>New Business</h3>
                        <h4><em>NAPP / NDOP Steering Committee Meeting</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley announced that the next NAPP / NDOP Steering 
                          Committee Meeting will be held here in Arkansas from 
                          October 15-18. She invited Shelby Johnson to share the 
                          details.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that the Arkansas Geographic Information 
                          Office will host the meeting and that this is a group 
                          of Federal agencies, including one representative from 
                          the National States Geographic Information Council. 
                          He described this group as the people who set the policy 
                          and direction for the National Aerial Photography Program 
                          and the National Digital Ortho Program. Shelby said 
                          that they are interested in learning about the ADOP 
                          project and GeoStor and some of the applications of 
                          the data. He said that he will have a four-hour block 
                          of time to present to this steering committee some examples 
                          of key projects that are going on in Arkansas. Shelby 
                          described the committee as being made of members from 
                          the Farm Services Agency, USGS, NRCS, FEMA, EPA, and 
                          NGSC. They bring in people who run projects from the 
                          NSGS to share information. Suzanne Wiley suggested that 
                          Shelby invite Pixxures to participate in his demonstration 
                          of the ADOP and Shelby agreed that this might be possible.</p>
                        <h4><em>I-Team Initiative</em></h4>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley revisited the I-Team Initiative which 
                          Ron Matzner presented at the last meeting. She said 
                          she feels the Board needs to be on the list with that 
                          Initiative and that there are good possiblities in the 
                          project. Shelby explained that he has a contact name 
                          with the Stephens Company as someone to possibly help 
                          with the nationwide Financing Solutions Team. Suzanne 
                          described how representatives need to be appointed from 
                          each Federal agency to be on the Federal partners team. 
                          She added that the members need to define the Board's 
                          I-Team direction, and that the Board needs to move forward 
                          on the strategic plan. </p>
                        <h4><em>NSGIC Meeting</em></h4>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reminded the membersthat the next NSGIC 
                          conference will be in St. Louis on September 7-12 and 
                          that he and Learon Dalby will be attending. Shelby announced 
                          that he has been nominated to serve on the board of 
                          the NSGIC and elections will be held at the conference.</p>
                        <h3>Future Meetings</h3>
                        <p>The members decided to have the subcommittees meet 
                          during September and that the next regular meeting will 
                          be at a dinner meeting on October 9th, prior to the 
                          GIS Users Forum Conference. </p>
                        <p>Discussion was held regarding the organization of an 
                          introduction luncheon meeting between the Board and 
                          Advisory Panel and the new State CIO. This will be scheduled 
                          as soon as possible following the appointment of the 
                          CIO.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
