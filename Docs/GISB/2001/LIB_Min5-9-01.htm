                        <p>The meeting was called to order in the Union Plaza 
                          Building 17th Floor Conference Room. The minutes from 
                          April 4, 2001, were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley welcomed the Advisory Panel members who 
                          were attending.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report of the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p><b><em>NAPP / DOQQs</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson showed various graphics illustrating 
                          the delivery schedule of the NAPP project, areas remaining 
                          to be flown and areas that were reflown. He explained 
                          that the graphs showing MrSID and the TIF files indicate 
                          that all of Lafayette County, half of Columbia County, 
                          and a portion of Miller County have been received from 
                          the contractor. They are in the process of reviewing 
                          the files. Another graphic illustrated the 2nd generation 
                          DOQQs sent to the Mid-continent Mapping Center for review, 
                          and Shelby explained that all data that has been sent 
                          to the USGS for review has been accepted into the national 
                          database. Things are progressing very smoothly. Shelby 
                          explained that they hope to have all data from the contractor 
                          by September or October.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Corps of Engineers River Project</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that data from the river corridor 
                          flights will be loaded into GeoStor at one-foot resolution 
                          by June. The LIDAR DEMs have been delivered and the 
                          five-foot vector contours are being processed. He added 
                          that the Corps of Engineers have already been using 
                          the terrain data on some of their projects and are pleased 
                          with the results.</p>
                        <h3>Old Business</h3>
                        <p><b><em>GeoStor</em></b></p>
                        <p>Bob Harris, team leader for the GeoStor project, reported 
                          that they have tracked approximately 5,000 downloads 
                          since GeoStor was made accessible. He explained that 
                          they are working on documentation of the system. They 
                          are working on moving all the metadata in the database 
                          into the FGDC clearinghouse and that is proceeding well 
                          and all data should be moved in the next month. Bob 
                          explained that one of the big pushes is raster functionality. 
                          They are moving to the new server and that will allow 
                          better delivery of raster data. They are tuning the 
                          programming in order to allow a queuing system for data 
                          requests, and there will be file size limits in place.</p>
                        <p>Bob described the data development and said that the 
                          1:25,000 DRGs will be available as soon as they move 
                          the data to the new server. Soils for Madison and Clay 
                          Counties will be available very soon. The DOQQ data 
                          is waiting on the new server. Some winter TM scenes 
                          from 1999 and 2000 should be available within a few 
                          days.</p>
                        <p>Bob described the new server as being an E4500 Sun 
                          Server, and said that the system administration people 
                          are working on loading the operating system and hardware 
                          up and running. They&#146;re starting to load application 
                          software and then they will begin migrating data to 
                          that new system. Hopefully, it will be turned on for 
                          the public in about six weeks. </p>
                        <p>Regarding the initial certificate requirement, he said 
                          that this is not needed any longer. He explained that 
                          for Java code to write to your computer, a certificate 
                          was needed. He said that the certificate installation 
                          was complicated and so they have contracted with Verisign 
                          and the certificate is installed in Java products already. 
                          CAST is now certified by Verisign so that the certificate 
                          download is not necessary anymore and it has made the 
                          data available to some people who couldn&#146;t access 
                          the system previously. He added that being certified 
                          by Verisign shows that you&#146;re a legitimate organization 
                          and is a lot like buying insurance.</p>
                        <p>Bob explained that they had been doing testing based 
                          on realistic circumstances and that the response times 
                          will improve a great deal on the new system, particularly 
                          for the raster data.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Legislation</em></b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley thanked the Advisory Panel Members, Shelby 
                          Johnson, and Learon Dalby for their efforts in supporting 
                          legislation affecting GIS issues. She then reviewed 
                          the legislative outcome of pertinent bills:</p>
                        <ol>

                              will now be the State Geographic Information Coordinator 
                              and the Arkansas Geographic Information Office has 
                              been created; statements are included to charge 
                              the Land Information Board to investigate cadastral 
                              issues for the state.<br />

                              know how much funding the Board will receive, if

                        <p>Learon Dalby reported that the proposal to set standards 
                          for GPS usage was discussed in the GIS Users Forum meeting 
                          on May 9. He explained that he has been posting comments 
                          and answers to the web site for public viewing. Some 
                          of the comments were:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>There is a difference between recreational and 
                              mapping GPS units and there are concerns that there 
                              will be restraints on people as to what to buy, 
                              which is not the intention of the standards document. 
                              A list will be compiled of recommended units for 
                              GPS mapping.'</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p> Questions regarding whether GPS data that is not 
                              collected to standards will be considered &#147;poor 
                              data.&#148; The answer was that the standards are 
                              set up to be a baseline and different projects may 
                              warrant different standards. Metadata will address 
                              different needs.</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Learon explained that he will be proposing a significant 
                          changes to the Board regarding lowering the number of 
                          points required to three points and have in the metadata 
                          how many positions were acquired for a point feature. 
                          He added that he&#146;s had some very positive support 
                          for this standards document. He said that May 20th closes 
                          the open public review. Learon will summarize the changes 
                          that have been suggested and will submit those to the 
                          Board for consideration. </p>
                        <p>Mike Mitchell pointed out four benefits of having GPS 
                          standards:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>It will provide a baseline for procedures for collecting 
                              data</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>It will provide some basis for contractual agreements 
                            </p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>It will provide some level of dependability and 
                              consistency in data sharing and this requires standards</p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Emphasis will be put on the capabilities of GPS units 
                          as opposed to price, and this will provide support for 
                          the user in the field regarding purchasing the proper 
                          equipment</p>
                        <p>Discussion followed regarding GPS guidelines versus 
                          GPS standards and the different needs of various user 
                          groups. Learon suggested that the document remain a 
                          standards document, but that guidelines be used regarding 
                          GPS units themselves, and that metadata be used to clarify 
                          the accuracy of specific data. A committee was formed 
                          consisting of Mike Daniels, Randy Jones, Tracy Ford, 
                          and Paul Medley to assist Learon regarding guidelines 
                          for GPS accuracy and settings for better accuracy.</p>
                        <p><b><em>GeoStor Metadata Standards</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained the need for metadata standards 
                          for GeoStor. He pointed out that any data from federal 
                          sources will be properly documented and loaded, but 
                          that there will be many other sources of data that have 
                          no properly document metadata. By requiring documented 
                          metadata, it will streamline the process of doing data 
                          loads into GeoStor. He shared that he and Learon attended 
                          a metadata training class recently in Nashville by the 
                          Federal Geographic Data Committee and a &#147;Train 
                          the Metadata Trainer&#148; workshop. He said they networked 
                          with a number of other states to see how they are addressing 
                          these issues. He consulted with Debbie Harmon from CAST, 
                          who is building the metadata in the geolibrary, and 
                          the Arkansas geolibrary, which is now going to be connected 
                          with the linkages from GeoStor. Shelby says there is 
                          a draft recommendation as to what the state should adopt 
                          as the standard, so that user could address the metadata 
                          elements and provide their data and have that loaded 
                          into GeoStor. </p>
                        <p>Shelby described how his office has started negotiation 
                          with a company called RTSE, which makes a software called 
                          SMMS, a metadata creation tool. He said his office is 
                          exploring the possibility of doing a statewide license 
                          for this software, which will include training, support, 
                          and documentation. He said that SMMS will work reasonably 
                          well with all the different products being used across 
                          the state. </p>
                        <p>He talked about how federal standards are strict in 
                          the seven sections of the metadata content standard, 
                          and the Board will not have to deal with actually developing 
                          standards. The issue will be which parts of the federal 
                          standards the Board will need to adopt that facilitate 
                          moving data into GeoStor. </p>
                        <p><b><em>Board Reappointments</em></b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained to the Board members that they 
                          will all be sent letters before their terms expire. 
                          The three agency Board members will be appointed under 
                          old law for four-year terms. The other nine board members 
                          will fall under the new legislation and will have their 
                          terms staggered. She pointed out that about one-half 
                          of the board members are fulfilling the original 1997 
                          appointment terms of other members. That means that 
                          even though they have not fulfilled a full term, it 
                          will count as being appointed to a term. The other nine 
                          members will be reappointed to one-year, two-year, or 
                          three-year terms. This may lead to very short active 
                          terms for some members.</p>
                        <p><b><em>AUTIS</em></b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that Learon Dalby drew up a 
                          grant proposal, it was edited, and then sent to the 
                          Association of Users of Telecommunications and Information 
                          Systems group. This grant would provide some funding 
                          to train stakeholders in the use of GeoStor. </p>
                        <h3><b>New Business</b></h3>
                        <p><b><em>I-Team Initiative</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that about two years ago, 
                          the Federal Geographic Data Committee commissioned a 
                          study in which they looked at alternative methods to 
                          fund the development of current spatial data, particularly 
                          the seven layers of the framework. It gets away from 
                          state and federal budget cycles and looks at creative 
                          ways of funding such as bond financing. FGDC had an 
                          opportunity to present the study to the Office of Management 
                          and Budget of the president and that spawned a new initiative 
                          focusing on NSDI. The points are that partnerships should 
                          be state/local/federal/private and all could share costs; 
                          mechanisms for allocating and sharing would encourage 
                          data development and stewardship; investors in spatial 
                          infrastructure could use common criteria. Shelby pointed 
                          out that these points are already subscribed to by the 
                          Board. He explained that the fourth point made by the 
                          study is new, and is that creative financing outside 
                          of government appropriation cycles, such as infrastructure 
                          bonds or other financial products, could supplement 
                          and de-politicize the funding process, providing the 
                          liquidity to deploy and sustain shared spatial infrastructure. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby went on to explain that Implementation Teams 
                          have been initiated from this effort. The I-Team initiative 
                          is to have federal/state/local/private representation 
                          sitting together to plan the development of the framework 
                          layers and other layers of statewide or regional importance. 
                          What the FGDC brings to the table is a financing solutions 
                          team. What they do is take all the layers, look at the 
                          issues, look at building a business case with a value 
                          proposition for financing, and then explore better uses 
                          of budgeting and procurement processes and look at alternative 
                          funding. Shelby said that one of the good points is 
                          that because it is being sponsored by the OMB, they 
                          can go to the federal agencies in state like NRCS, and 
                          they can ask that federal agency what part of their 
                          agency budget aligns with the direction the state is 
                          going. And if there is a part of that federal agency 
                          budget that does align with the state direction, the 
                          federal agency can be directed to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that one of the key elements that 
                          the Board and Advisory Panel will have to do is write 
                          a strategic plan. </p>
                        <p><b><em>AmericaView Project</em></b></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the USGS manages the 
                          Landsat missions. The EROS data center in South Dakota 
                          has the downlink station, and they have developed a 
                          model project where the State of Ohio is able pay up 
                          front and have direct link to data by FTP. This allows 
                          them to receive new data in days instead of weeks. Ray 
                          Fox from USGS has sponsored a meeting with representatives 
                          from the EROS data center, Mid-Continent Mapping Center, 
                          CAST, Suzanne Wiley, and Shelby Johnson. They shared 
                          information regarding GeoStor and the EROS data center 
                          and discussed doing a pilot project to have satellite 
                          imagery from Arkansas sent to GeoStor within 36 hours 
                          after acquisition. A test will be run on June 14th with 
                          using Landsat 7 as a proof of concept, from getting 
                          the satellite imager to Fayetteville and CAST will provide 
                          the raw and processed data. </p>
                        <p>Shelby said that users will be invited to examine the 
                          data to see what the value might be. Shelby explained 
                          that if the technology works, it would be possible for 
                          the Board to enter into an agreement with the USGS to 
                          do satellite acquisition by this model at a much reduced 
                          rate. He thinks the advantage is the turnaround time 
                          to have a timely dataset in the hands of users who could 
                          benefit from this data in such a short timeframe, such 
                          as farmers. Following the success of the first test, 
                          on June 30th a whole path of three scenes would be processed 
                          and put out on GeoStor for review. </p>
                        <p>Shelby pointed out that this is a chance to develop 
                          a program that has never been done before by any other 
                          state.</p>
                        <p><b><em>Smart Moves</em></b></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley described a recognition program called 
                          Smart Moves, which is administered through the Governor&#146;s 
                          Office and that recognizes proactive uses of technology 
                          by state agencies. It was agreed that this would be 
                          a good opportunity to publicize the work of the Board 
                          and CAST by highlighting the GeoStor initiative, and 
                          an application will be submitted.</p>
                        <h3><b>Future Meetings</b></h3>
                        <p>A tentative meeting was set for June 6th, at which 
                          time officers will be elected. There will be no July 
                          meeting, and the August meeting will be scheduled at 
                          a later time. <br />
                          <br />
                          Suzanne Wiley thanked the Advisory Panel members for 
                          attending and encouraged them to share their suggestions 
                          and recommendations with the Board in the future, since 
                          they represent a wide range of GIS users in the state. 
                          She also invited panel members to participate in any 
                          of the special subcommittees if they are interested.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>
