                          Kimberly Bogart. She will be working half time on the 
                          Arkansas Centerline File (ACF) program and the County 
                          Assessors Mapping Program (CAMP), and half time on the

                          <span class="reg10pointBOLD"> FEMA FloodMap Modernization</span><br />
                          The AGIO has been working with the Arkansas Soil &amp; 
                          Water Conservation Commission (ASWCC) Floodplain Management 
                          Division over the past year to develop the state&#8217;s 
                          GIS resources to support the FloodMap Modernization 
                          program. Over the next five years, all of the maps used 
                          by the National Flood Insurance Program will be updated 
                          and converted to digital format on a county basis using 
                          local-level GIS data. A grant from FEMA will fund the 
                          project which includes inventory and cataloging of high-resolution 
                          elevation data and orthoimagery from local sources, 
                          the development of metadata, and loading the data into 
                          GeoStor in accordance with LIB data loading policy. 
                          There are currently FloodMap Modernization projects 
                          underway in six Arkansas counties: Benton, Columbia, 
                          Craighead, Pulaski, Union, and Washington. AGIO is proactively 
                          assisting Benton and Washington Counties with high-resolution 
                          imagery and elevation data development projects. </p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">FDHS ITEP Grant</span><br />
                          The AGIO had previously submitted a proposal to the 
                          Federal Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Information 
                          Technology Evaluation Program to support the development 
                          and update of centerline data around three assets critical 
                          to homeland security. The proposal was unsuccessful; 
                          however, the AGIO believes that the proposal is thorough 
                          and well-written and will consider it for resubmission 
                          next year or for submission to a different granting 
                          agency. Shelby noted that three of the 10 projects funded 
                          through ITEP grants were GIS-related. </p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">FGDC CAP Grants</span><br />
                          The AGIO submitted two successful proposals to the Federal 
                          Geographic Data Committee&#8217;s Cooperative Agreements 
                          Program. The first grant awarded funds to facilitate 
                          intensive follow-up training, tentatively scheduled 
                          for early November, for the county assessors&#8217; 
                          offices participating in CAMP. A second CAP grant was 
                          awarded for CAST to development an interactive web mapping 
                          site drawing road centerlines, boundaries, and cadastral 
                          data from GeoStor.&nbsp;This demonstration project will 
                          be available through an Internet browser when completed.</p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">CMRS Grant</span><br />
                          The AGIO submitted a proposal at the LIB&#8217;s request 
                          to the Commercial Mobile Radio Service Board to facilitate 
                          development of centerline data for all Arkansas counties. 
                          At its August meeting the CMRS Board voted not to fund 
                          the proposal.</p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">Wireless 911 Booklet</span><br />
                          The public service booklets describing the mapping requirements 
                          and phases of FCC Wireless E-911 has been widely distributed 
                          to legislators; municipal police chiefs; and the judges, 
                          sheriffs, and E-911 officials of each county. They were 
                          produced by the AGIO and funded by the Arkansas GIS 
                          Users Forum. </p>

                          The AGIO recently engaged in securing map resources 
                          of the region surrounding the William J. Clinton Presidential 
                          Center. They were needed for security personnel unfamiliar 
                          with the area. Digital Globe orthoimagery for all of 
                          Pulaski County was procured through a partnership with 
                          the Pulaski Area GIS, Pulaski County, USGS, Metroplan, 
                          the Arkansas National Guard, and the Arkansas Department 
                          of Emergency Management. Under Digital Globe&#8217;s 
                          restructured licensing agreements the data will be accessible 
                          in GeoStor sometime after the Center opens. </p>

                          Operations Database Survey</span><br />
                          The AGIO is teaming with ADEM and the Forestry Commission 
                          to complete a comprehensive Fire Station survey that 
                          will be used for homeland security purposes. Existing 
                          fire station coordinate data from the Forestry Commission 
                          along with station level details are to be surveyed 
                          and verified. All emergency operations centers in the 
                          state will also be located. The anticipated completion 
                          date is early 2005. AGIO is increasingly supporting 
                          the homeland security activities of ADEM and is scheduled 
                          to attend National Incident Command System training 
                          in October.</p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">The President's High Growth 
                          Job Training Initiative</span><br />
                          The President's High Growth Job Training is a strategic 
                          effort to prepare workers to take advantage of new and 
                          increasing job opportunities in high growth/high demand 
                          and economically vital industries and sectors of the 
                          American economy. In September the Department of Labor 
                          announced it would award $4.5 million for geospatial 
                          worker training in its first round of grants through 
                          the initiative. The AGIO met with staff from the Arkansas 
                          Workforce Investment Board to discuss submitting a proposal 
                          for Arkansas. The Workforce Investment Board anticipates 
                          the next round of grants through this program will be 
                          announced in early 2005. The AGIO goal would be to increase 
                          the availability of geospatial worker training specifically 
                          for county personnel in the County Assessor offices 
                          and county workers involved in road centerline data 
                          development. For more information about the President&#8217;s

                          audit forms in support of the Board&#8217;s effort to 
                          get GIS job positions described within the state personnel 
                          framework. The draft classifications include the following 
                          position classes: GIS Technician, GIS Analyst I, GIS 
                          Analyst II, GIS Analyst III, and GIS Coordinator. At 
                          this time the AGIO does not know when these would be 
                          finalized. </p>

                          Bill Sneed and Shelby Johnson traveled to Fort Smith 
                          for a project wrap-up meeting on this project funded 
                          by the US Geological Survey. The project received significant 
                          local press coverage and is a great example for a municipality 
                          to take advantage of GIS technology in economic development.</p>

                          In August the AGIO issued a press release through the 
                          Arkansas GIS Users Forum listserve announcing the first 
                          availability of county assessor mapping data through 
                          the CAMP program. This marks a major milestone for GIS 
                          in Arkansas. The first three counties loaded in GeoStor 
                          are Boone, Cross, and Van Buren counties. Randolph and 
                          Clay counties are expected to be loaded in the very 
                          near future.<br />

                          Shelby drew the Board&#8217;s attention to the Graphic 
                          of the Month on the AGIO website (http://www.gis.state.ar.us/AGIO/Map_gallery.htm).

                          legislature&#8217;s Joint Committee on Educational Facilities 
                          is in the process of assessing all public school facilities 
                          in Arkansas. AGIO has been asked to develop an online 
                          application through which legislators will be able to 
                          access facility assessment data by clicking on school 
                          locations. The application is due to be released to 
                          the legislature in November and should include much 
                          of the data used to formulate the school report. </p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">School District Boundaries</span><br />
                          The AGIO worked closely with the Arkansas Public Service 
                          Commission to develop a press release delivered to all 
                          regulated utilities conducting business in Arkansas. 
                          The release announced the availability of the new school 
                          district boundary data for the utilities to use in the 
                          tax calculations by district. </p>

                          Shelby provided the Board with a GeoStor Usage Status 
                          Report outlining GeoStor usage since the rollout of 
                          GeoSurf 4.0 in July 2004 and since the inception of 
                          GeoStor in December 2000. He also drew attention to 
                          the more than 500 new users who have been added recently 
                          and attributed at least part of the increase to the 
                          news release that went out to utilities about school 
                          districts.</p>

                          ADOP II<br />
                          An RFP for ADOP II was posted to the AGIO website on 
                          September 30th, with a 30-day deadline. Evaluation of 
                          submissions will begin in early November, along with 
                          continued solicitation of funds. </p>
                        <h3>Advisory Council Members Meeting</h3>
                        <p> Randy Jones stated that First Electric Coop would 
                          host the upcoming Advisory Council meeting and provide 
                          lunch. Suzanne reviewed the Advisory Council&#8217;s 
                          three major functions: addressing the GIS needs of the 
                          state, identifying and prioritizing appropriate GIS 
                          projects, and lobbying. Suzanne moved that the Board 
                          move forward on planning an advisory meeting. Judge 
                          Hudson seconded the motion. The motion passed.</p>

                          that the Governor had appointed a replacement for Mike, 
                          who is no longer with DIS. </p>

                          Research on the matter of travel reimbursement. The 
                          LIB can follow the same procedure as other boards, and 
                          vote to authorize for travel reimbursement at its first 
                          annual meeting. </p>

                          Phyllis stated she will be doing some editing to the 
                          LIB brochure and a draft will be presented at the next 
                          meeting.</p>

                          the Office of Information Technology is October 21st. 
                          The AGIO would like to approach the budget hearing with 
                          a strong demonstration of support from users, stakeholders, 
                          and supporters, particularly from the LIB and its constituency. 
                          Judge Hudson moved that the Board draft a letter of

                          The Arkansas Geological Commission has been participating 
                          in the STATEMAP program, the state component of the 
                          National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, which 
                          is aimed at creating better geology data each of the 
                          states. AGC is making a proposal again this year, and 
                          the AGIO will be assisting AGC with finalizing metadata 
                          and getting the data into GeoStor. Judge Hudson moved 
                          that the Board send a letter to the state geologist 
                          in support of its STATEMAP proposal. Suzanne seconded 
                          the motion. The motion passed. The AGIO will draft a

                          Shelby brought the Board a project budget and financial 
                          plan for the watershed delineation project, which is 
                          aimed at providing information about the natural resources 
                          in the state. The effort is to create 1:24k-res watershed 
                          boundaries statewide (currently available data are at 
                          1:100k statewide, with some higher-resolution areas).He 
                          pointed out that this is a good example of cooperative 
                          development of data. Individual agencies contributing 
                          to the watershed delineation project include ADEQ, AG&amp;F, 
                          AGC, and ASWCC in addition to NRCS and USGS. Bill Sneed 
                          reminded the Board that NRCS&#8217;s data certification 
                          program requires that the data for the entire state 
                          has to be complete before it can be certified and released.

                          Shelby told the Board that Mr. Scott Bruner, the interim 
                          director of OGC, has been working towards spatially 
                          enabling OGC&#8217;s existing online data. Shelby is

                          said that the raw LIDAR data for northwest Arkansas

                          Shelby suggested that the Board go to Directions Magazine 
                          (http://www.directionsmag.com/) for coverage of the 
                          conference (http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=660&amp;trv=1). 
                          NSGIC hosted a week-long conference of 47 states working 
                          on GIS coordination. It included representatives and 
                          regional staff from many major federal programs, including 
                          the FGDC, FEMA, and the Census Bureau regional staff, 
                          among others. Next year&#8217;s conference will be held 
                          in Rochester, NY. Shelby encouraged all Board members 
                          to attend, and mentioned that the conference focuses 
                          not on software or techniques but on coordination activities, 
                          which are the goals of the LIB and the AGIO. The 2006 
                          NSGIC conference will be hosted by Arkansas.</p>
                        <h3>Adjournment</h3>
                        <p> Judge Hudson moved that the Board adjourn. The motion 
                          was seconded by Russell Gibson. The motion passed unanimously.<br />
