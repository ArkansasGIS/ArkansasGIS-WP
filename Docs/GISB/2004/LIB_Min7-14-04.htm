                        <h3>Report from State Geographic Information Coordinator 
                        </h3>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson gave a report on the activities of the 
                          AGIO. Since the last meeting, the AGIO has applied for 
                          several federal grants. </p>
                        <h5>FDHS ITEP Grant</h5>
                        <p> The Federal Department of Homeland Security (FDHS) 
                          announced an Information Technology Evaluation Program 
                          (ITEP), administered by the DHS Office for Domestic 
                          Preparedness and the Office of the Chief Information 
                          Officer. The program is geared towards developing information 
                          technology projects to enhance homeland security. The 
                          AGIO made a proposal to ITEP to support an update of 
                          centerline data around three critical assets.</p>
                        <p>The announcement of the ITEP award should be in September.</p>
                        <h5>FGDC CAP Grants</h5>
                        <p> The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Cooperative 
                          Agreements Program (CAP) funds work in support of the 
                          goals of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure, including 
                          development of web feature services, development of 
                          metadata, and participation in The National Map. The 
                          AGIO participated in three proposals for CAP funding: 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li> The AGIO assisted CAST with a proposal to improve 
                            its web feature services to increase the functionality 
                            of GeoStor. </li>
                          <li> Funds were applied for to support the automation 
                            and replication of Fort Smith data in GeoStor and 
                            The National Map. </li>
                          <li> The AGIO applied for funds to bring together participants 
                            in the County Assessor Mapping Program (CAMP). </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Announcement of FGDC award(s) should be out in late 
                          August or early September.</p>
                        <h5> CMRS Grant</h5>
                        <p> At the SLIB&#8217;s request, the AGIO made a proposal 
                          to the Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) Board 
                          to aid in the development and completion of centerline 
                          data for all counties throughout the state. Shelby presented 
                          a brief version of AGIO&#8217;s July 20th presentation 
                          to the CMRS Board. The presentation included information 
                          on the background of the AR Centerline File (ACF) Program. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Tangent to the discussion of the CMRS grant, Shelby 
                          gave an overview of the current state of the ACF Program. 
                          The AGIO&#8217;s presentation included sample costs 
                          for the ACF Program. </p>
                        <p>Shelby passed out copies of a public service booklet 
                          which explains the phases of FCC Wireless E9-1-1. The 
                          booklet was produced by the AGIO and funded by the Arkansas 
                          GIS Users Forum. </p>
                        <p>CMRS tabled their decision on providing funding for 
                          the ACF Program until their August meeting.</p>
                        <p>Judge Hudson moved that the SLIB go on record as supporting 
                          AGIO&#8217;s proposal to the CMRS Board. Shelby indicated 
                          that a letter to the CMRS Board would be a welcome measure 
                          of support. Judge Hudson moved that the SLIB send a 
                          letter of support to the CMRS Board regarding AGIO&#8217;s 
                          proposal. Yancey Reynolds seconded the motion. The motion 
                          passed unanimously. </p>

                          The current status of the ACF Program was addressed 
                          in the course of the AGIO&#8217;s discussion of their 
                          proposal to the CMRS Board. Currently 16 counties have 
                          achieved the state standards. Seven counties are out 
                          for bid. Seven counties have contractors in the field 
                          right now. Nineteen feature vendors have signed FV MOUs.

                        <p>The Census Bureau is doing geometry mapping in five

                          to the state, and the AGIO will work with the counties 
                          to compile the attribute data. </p>

                          At the end of June, AGIO staff members attended a county 
                          clerks&#8217; conference in Eureka Springs. Clerks from 
                          about 65 counties spent a day being introduced to GIS, 
                          the SLIB programs, GeoStor, and the AGIO&#8217;s HAVA 
                          pilot project in Madison and Monroe counties. Shelby 
                          expressed a desire for a project aimed at county clerks, 
                          who could benefit substantially from GIS technology

                          Bill Sneed acquired USGS funding to replicate Fort Smith&#8217;s 
                          data in GeoStor on The National Map website. Bill discussed 
                          the very positive response received by a presentation 
                          about Fort Smith&#8217;s data at MidAmerica GIs Consortium 
                          Conference (MAGIC). The next step will be to acquire 
                          a live linkage so that GeoStor&#8217;s Fort Smith data 
                          are always live in The National Map. Shelby pointed 
                          out the significance of the Fort Smith project, which 
                          may pave the way for communities such as Hot Springs,

                          no response. Suzanne said that she has a new email address

                          Learon presented a report on the status of Arkansas 
                          Digital Ortho Program (ADOP) II. The AGIO have hosted 
                          4-5 aerial photography companies to learn about the 
                          newest digital sensor technology. There are multiple 
                          options: the entire state could be done at one-meter 
                          resolution, or one-meter resolution in rural areas and 
                          one-foot resolution in urban areas, or any combination 
                          thereof. Learon showed examples of both three-band and 
                          near-infrared images of the same area. AGIO staff members 
                          have talked to previous cooperators and there is interest 
                          but no money committed to date. </p>
                        <p>There was general agreement that if the SLIB is to 
                          pursue a 2005 update, the SLIB should put out an RFP 
                          to refine cost estimates. Shelby suggested that the 
                          RFP include proposals both for a square mile at one-meter 
                          resolution and for a square mile at one-foot resolution. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A motion was made by Suzanne to put out an RFP for 
                          the update of DOQQ imagery. The motion was seconded 
                          by Mary Kay and passed unanimously. </p>
                        <h3>Board Members</h3>
                        <p> Suzanne stated that all private-sector Board member 
                          terms end in August. The Board needs to submit names 
                          to the governor as suggestions for replacement members. 
                          Phyllis suggested that everyone gives the matter some 
                          thought and that further discussion could take place 
                          on the listserve. </p>
                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">Replacement for Mike McGibbony</span><br />
                          Phyllis informed the Board that Mike McGibbony has not 
                          submitted a letter of resignation yet. </p>
                        <h3>Advisory Council Meeting </h3>
                        <p> Suzanne suggested that the Board set a tentative date 
                          for the next Advisory Council meeting. Randy Jones had 
                          previously volunteered First Electric&#8217;s boardroom 
                          as a meeting facility. Todd Schroeder confirmed that 
                          First Electric can host the meeting, and will check 
                          on facilities and dates.</p>
                        <p>Judge Hudson asked the Board to consider its goals 
                          for a meeting with of the Advisory Council. Observations 
                          that were made included:<br />
                          the Council had not met in a long time; <br />
                          the SLIB could benefit from input from the Advisory 
                          Council;<br />
                          desired legislation could be presented to the Advisory 
                          Council; and<br />
                          the SLIB would be able to take advantage of heightened 
                          enthusiasm for an imagery <br />
                          update and have the Council help identify potential 
                          sources of income. </p>
                        <p>Judge Hudson suggested that the staff put together 
                          a professional program for presentation to the Advisory 
                          Council. </p>
                        <p>General discussion resulted in a consensus that late 
                          October, before October 24th, would be the most appropriate 
                          time for a meeting of the Advisory Council. </p>

                          expenses and DIS representative</span><br />
                          Phyllis raised the question of reimbursement for travel 
                          expenses for Board members. Bill Bush stated that there 
                          is a piece of legislation covering all boards&#8217; 
                          stipends and expenses, which could potentially be amended 
                          to include the SLIB. This piece of legislation would 
                          supersede the SLIB&#8217;s current legislation.</p>
                        <p>Shelby pointed out that the SLIB&#8217;s current legislation 
                          uses the term &#8220;compensation,&#8221; not &#8220;reimbursement.&#8221; 
                          He said that he is in the process of seeking advice 
                          from the Bureau of Legislative Research to clarify the 
                          difference between the two. If reimbursement for travel 
                          expenses is not considered compensation, then travel 
                          expenses could be written into the SLIB&#8217;s operating 
                          budget. </p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the SLIB would wait to hear clarification 
                          from the Bureau of Legislative Research. <br />

                          AGIO. Comments from the Board were solicited regarding 
                          the SLIB brochure. </p>
                        <p>Phyllis stated that it was important that the brochure 
                          not include data that would &#8220;date&#8221; the brochure. 
                          This would provide a longer shelf life to the brochure.

                          <br />

                          Learon updated the Board on the status of AGIO&#8217;s 
                          partnership with the Arkansas Highway and Transportation 
                          Department. Robert Fuhler, AR GIS Users Forum Chair, 
                          invited GeoStor and CAST staff to make a presentation 
                          to AHTD staff. Brian Culpepper gave a brief outline 
                          of CAST&#8217;s presentation to the AHTD, during which 
                          Fred Limp led a primarily technical discussion of GeoStor&#8217;s 
                          resources. </p>
                        <p>It was observed that AHTD would make a good partner 
                          for ADOP II and hope was expressed that AHTD will become 
                          involved in the process. Shelby confirmed the initiative 
                          that Robert has taken in establishing a good relationship 
                          between the AHTD and AGIO and also commended Brian for

                        <p><span class="reg10pointBOLD">Forum Suggestions</span><br />
                          At the last GIS Users Forum meeting, Fred Limp mentioned 
                          the possibility of Forum members&#8217; input to the 
                          SLIB. Phyllis sent two emails to the Forum listserve 
                          requesting input. She received only one reply. It voiced 
                          concern that the SLIB was not watching the GIS certification 
                          issue close enough. Phyllis assured the Forum member 
                          that the Board was staying abreast of the certification 
                          issues. A discussion ensued concerning the role of the 
                          Board in certification. The consensus was that the Board, 
                          by legislative mandate, is not a regulatory agency and 
                          can not serve that role.</p>

                          Phyllis asked the Board to consider what legislation 
                          might be desirable. Shelby pointed out that SLIB would 
                          have a harder time getting legislation passed without 
                          Senator Brenda Gullett who has served as our legislative 
                          sponsor, and asked the Board to consider appropriate 
                          legislative representatives whom they could ask for 
                          support. </p>
                        <p>Judge Hudson raised the point that special interests 
                          need to understand the connection of GIs to economic
