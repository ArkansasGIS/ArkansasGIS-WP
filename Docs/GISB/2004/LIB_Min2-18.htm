                          We need to maintain awareness of Federal activities 
                          (USGS) related to Arkansas. <br />
                          Fred Limp brought up the issue that state vector data 
                          is out of date (latest is 2000). Discussion followed 
                          about the possibility of working with AR Highway and 
                          Transportation Department (AHTD) mapping division on 
                          obtaining updated data. Following a discussion on issues 
                          existing with AHTD, in particular, security, liability, 
                          and education, NAD27, and CAD vector format. Learon 
                          is currently working on cost models. <br />
                          Fred moved to charge AGIO to draft resolution content 
                          in re: AHTD data importance. David Hudson seconded the 
                          motion. Phyllis asked for vote. Motion unanimously passed. 
                          Shelby will submit to list for review and present before 
                          next Board meeting.</p>

                          5. Report on GeoStor and related projects</p>
                        <p>Fred Limp distributed a GeoStor Usage Status Report. 
                          The orthophotography continues to be the most popular 
                          data set. (see report) Other topics discussed were new 
                          AHTD data; system being rolled over to new upgraded 
                          system; all NASA relevant software now ported to Linux; 
                          distributed file storage solution in development; and 
                          soils data close to completion (20 more counties should 
                          be online soon).</p>
                        <p>6. Old Business</p>
                        <p>Interim Study Committee conference calls<br />
                          Phyllis updated the Board on the committee&#8217;s consensus 
                          on revenue strategy. The first priority is funding for 
                          the AGIO. Every effort will be made to ensure that funding 
                          through the state&#8217;s general revenue fund continues. 
                          Increase in funding is needed for an education specialist. 
                          This position will provide relief for other staff to 
                          concentrate on their projects. The move of GeoStor will 
                          require additional funding also. AGIO will look at these 
                          issues and bring suggestions to Board. The Board will 
                          continue in its efforts to seek revenue for state and 
                          local GIS efforts as a separate issue. </p>
                        <p>State GIS Labor Force Survey<br />
                          Shelby disseminated the results of the survey. (see 
                          report) Jubal brought up the issue of state agencies 
                          that use GIS for a decision making tool, not in a technical 
                          capacity, most likely did not filled out the questionnaire. 
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>State GIS Job Descriptions Development<br />
                          Bill Bush reported that Shelby has descriptions from 
                          other states to use as guidelines. The approach will 
                          be to get descriptions of the duties being performed 
                          by existing state GIS personnel. Once the descriptions 
                          have been compiled they will be taken to OPM, who will 
                          audit them, base on survey results. The next step will 
                          be to look further to find common job descriptions, 
                          manager, mid, and entry level seem appropriate, then 
                          develop three position descriptions for these levels 
                          of responsibility, create new titles, and determine 
                          the costs involved with the reclassification and upgrades. 
                          Discrepancies in salary levels and actual job duties 
                          are prevalent. Committee will continue working on this.</p>

                          ADOP II Progress (see report)<br />
                          Learon discussed the completely digital process utilized 
                          by EarthData, who would be doing a demonstration on 
                          Friday, Feb 20th, for Forum members and other interested 
                          parties. Elevation/Lidar were also discussed. <br />
                          He emphasized the need for more substantial plans by 
                          this fall. General discussion followed on the technical 
                          aspects of new data acquisition techniques, time, processing 
                          cost savings, and the additional by-products that will 
                          be available through this method.</p>
                        <p>7. New Business</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley inquired as to possible AGIO projects 
                          the Board should make award nominations for the upcoming 
                          MidAmerica GI Symposium in Kansas City. Phyllis asked 
                          Board&#8217;s feeling on nominations (Board not independent). 
                          Shelby suggested counties should be nominated instead, 
                          highlight counties instead within CAMP.<br />
                          Fred said there was a greater benefit from Shelby suggestion. 
                          Suzanne moved that Shelby create text for nominations 
                          of county individuals and local efforts for MAGIC symposium. 
                          Specific counties to be named later (2 county nominations). 
                          Russell Gibson seconded the motion. Motion passed unanimously. 
                          Shelby pointed out the Board could also issue resolution 
                          for recognition of these counties.<br />
                          <br />
                          Interim Study Committee<br />
                          Shelby discussed the highlights of the interim study.</p>
                        <p>Reprioritize framework data development list <br />
                          Shelby requested the Board to reprioritize framework 
                          data development list that is based on Federal model 
                          data. He will email the Board a list of these layers 
                          for consideration.</p>
                        <p><br />
                          Review estimated costs of development for critical framework 
                          layers<br />
                          Learon discussed estimated costs.</p>
                        <p><br />
                          Determine strategies for revenue sources<br />
                          Shelby talked about several of ideas for revenue sources. 
                          However, nothing has been declared a viable source. 
                          He plans to speak with Preston Means, Department of 
                          Finance and Administration (DFA), about suggestions 
                          for possible sources. David Hudson spoke on issues, 
                          possible approaches. Shelby will meet with Tom Geist 
                          regarding bonds issue.</p>
                        <p>Advisory Council Members<br />
                          A list of the members of the Advisory Council members 
                          was passed out to Board. Phyllis said it was necessary 
                          to revisit the list due to members who are no longer 
                          in state or with organization they represent. Discussion 
                          followed addressing the obvious changes that had to 
                          be made and new organizations to include on council. 
                          How to involve the council more was discussed. It was 
                          stated that lunch would be necessary for a Board and 
                          Advisory Council meeting to take place. This in turn 
                          brought up the point of how to fund it? Since the Board 
                          is not currently funded, it will be necessary to look 
                          into Board funding for future functions. A possibility 
                          is to add line item into AGIO future budget to cover 
                          expenses such as travel and meeting expenses. The consensus 
                          was that financial remuneration was necessary to encourage 
                          more action from Advisory Council Members.<br />
                          The need to add private business to list was discussed, 
                          as they are under represented. Real estate, Acxiom, 
                          Wal-Mart, and the Farm Bureau were discussed. Since 
                          4-year higher education representatives are on the Board 
                          it was suggested that a 2-year representative would 
                          be appropriate. New representatives needed:</p>
                        <p>Education K-12 - Fred will review EAST</p>
                        <p>Education 2 and 4-year colleges - Vince will investigate 
                          a West Memphis college to better represent <br />
                          East Arkansas region.</p>
                        <p>GIs Users Forum - defer to Forum for nominations.</p>
                        <p>Transportation - defer to AHTD for nominations.</p>
                        <p><br />
                          Suzanne brought up the Board&#8217;s brochure and how 
                          outdated it is. A new/revised brochure would benefit 
                          its visibility.</p>
                        <p>Comments from guests<br />
                          Bill Snide spoke briefly about National Map development.</p>
                        <p>8. Future meeting dates - February / March<br />
                          The Board set March 17th, April 14th, and May 19th, 
                          as the tentative meeting dates for the next month. Board 
                          members are to check calendars for conflicts. </p>
                        <p>9. Adjournment <br />
                          Following the conclusion of business, a motion to adjourn 
                          was made by Mary Kay Sullivan and seconded by Bill Bush. 
                          The motion passed unanimously and the meeting adjourned 
                          at 12:17 p.m.</p>
