                          The meeting was called to order by interim Board Chair, 
                          Suzanne Wiley at 9:05 am. After review, Suzanne called 
                          for a motion to approve the minutes of the meeting of 
                          November 10, 2003. Bill Bush moved that the minutes 
                          be accepted as posted on the LIB listserve. Earl Smith 
                          seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.</p>
                        <p>2. Carolyn Walton, Executive Chief Information Officer

                          (See Attachment 1)</p>
                        <p>In order for all Board members to better understand 
                          the future legislative funding issues relevant to AGIO 
                          and GeoStor support, the Chair charged the AGIO with 
                          bringing figures on current revenues, sources and needs 
                          to the next Board meeting.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>3. Resolutions <br />
                          Suzanne Wiley thanked Bill Bush and Karen Walls for 
                          their invaluable assistance in preparing certificates 
                          and resolutions recognizing outgoing Board members. 
                          Bill Bush moved that the Board adopt resolutions recognizing 
                          the many years of service provided by former members 
                          Susan Cromwell, Shirley Sandlin, and Chris Boudreaux 
                          . Phyllis Smith seconded the motion. The motion passed 
                          unanimously and all Board members signed the resolutions.</p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson announced to the Board that Jim Wells 
                          will resign his Board appointment due to personal reasons. 
                          Suzanne asked Board members to suggest candidates who 
                          might be recommended to the Governor&#8217;s office 
                          as a possible appointee to finish the rest of this term.

                        <p>4. MidAmerica GIS Symposium &#8211; April 18-22, 2004<br />
                          Suzanne Wiley reminded Board members of the upcoming 
                          Symposium. Phyllis Smith and Learon Dalby encouraged 
                          those present to consider attending this event because 
                          of its many GIS educational opportunities from very 
                          basic to very sophisticated. It was further emphasized 
                          that the symposium includes many levels of participation 
                          and is composed of curricula and tracks to meet various 
                          needs.</p>
                        <p>5. Report from State Geographic Information Coordinator<br />
                          Shelby Johnson reported that Vince Guillet and Richie 
                          Pierce of the AGIO staff were unavailable for the meeting 
                          due to their field work in western Arkansas to test 
                          the centerlines in Polk, Scott and Sebastian counties. 
                          He stated for the purpose of the report he would cover 
                          their program areas as well as other highlights (See 
                          Attachment 2). He stated further that GIS and the ECIO 
                          are now included as explicit components in the new State 
                          Homeland Security Proposal, with emphasis on the importance 
                          of completed state centerlines and the crucial role 
                          of GeoStor as the state GIS data clearinghouse.</p>
                        <p>6. Report from other AR Geographic Information Office 
                          (AGIO) staff <br />
                          AR Centerline File Program (ACF) &#8211; Vince Guillet

                          Pierce (See Attachment 2)<br />
                          Cooperative project funding for AR Digital Ortho Program 
                          (ADOP), distributed funding model proposal &#8211; Joakim 
                          J&ouml;rwall (See Attachment 2)</p>
                        <p>7. Report on GeoStor and related projects <br />
                          Status of GeoStor development and usage &#8211; Fred 
                          Limp<br />
                          Fred Limp reported that GeoStor had been intermittently 
                          unavailable during the past few days as a result of 
                          Internet outages. He cited highlights from the regular 
                          report that showed usage of the system continues to 
                          grow. The aerial imagery continues to be the top downloaded 
                          file types, and the system has recorded in excess of 
                          208,000 total downloads. He reminded the Board that 
                          this is comparable to a much larger number of files 
                          in other systems because of the seamless delivery of 
                          data by GeoStor. Fred pointed out that the system now 
                          has over 3,300 registered users. He further mentioned 
                          that CAST had received funding from NASA, to enable 
                          migration onto Linux based systems. This would lower 
                          the systems costs substantially.</p>
                        <p>National Map pilot effort &#8211; Fred Limp<br />
                          Fred reported that the National Map pilot project was 
                          proceeding well.</p>
                        <p>8. Old Business<br />
                          Interim Study Committee - Timeline<br />
                          Shelby reported that the SLIB has only 20-25 weeks to 
                          complete a plan/study by May. He suggested that regular 
                          Board conference calls should be scheduled to assess 
                          the available options.</p>
                        <p>Tasks for Board and AGIO/SLIB pre-session promotion 
                          <br />
                          Following discussion of the Interim Study, Suzanne asked 
                          for volunteers to serve on a Task Force for Legislative 
                          Action. Bill Bush, Russell Gibson, Suzanne Wiley, Phyllis 
                          Smith, Randy Jones and Judge David Hudson offered to 
                          serve on this committee.</p>
                        <p>AR Digital Ortho Program (ADOP) II <br />
                          Funding sources / strategies<br />
                          Digital Ortho Standard<br />
                          A project to update 2000-2002 aerial photography was 
                          discussed. It is hoped that stake holders can be brought 
                          on board and that new photography can be acquired in 
                          2005. Shelby Johnson reported that the AGIO had not 
                          been able to devote the time necessary to begin research 
                          on a statewide digital ortho standard.</p>
                        <p>FEMA Floodmap Modernization Strategic Plan<br />
                          Shelby Johnson reported to the Board that the state 
                          committee developed to respond to the FEMA flood map 
                          modernization had developed a draft report. He reported 
                          that this committee is composed of Jason Donham, Johnny 
                          Mullens, and Mike Borengasser, all representing Arkansas 
                          Soil &amp; Water Conservation Commission, and Conrad 
                          Battreal, representing the Arkansas Flood Plain Managers 
                          Association. Shelby further mentioned that federal FEMA 
                          funding is available and that FEMA is able to match 
                          funds provided by cities or counties. Thus, the previous 
                          Digital Ortho Program provides data that are considered 
                          matching, resulting in real financial benefit to those 
                          areas participating in flood map modernization.</p>
                        <p>State GIS position descriptions<br />
                          Discussion centered upon the lack of formal GIS position 
                          descriptions within state government. Tracy Moy from 
                          the Arkansas Game &amp; Fish Commission pointed out 
                          that this creates a challenge for managers in state 
                          agencies who must place GIS personnel in positions that 
                          do not accurately describe their functions. This results 
                          in the employee being misclassified. Bill Bush stated 
                          he agreed with the assessment and that agencies that 
                          have GIS employees designate these positions by working 
                          title only. Bill mentioned that if the Board knew the 
                          number of GIS employees in state government it might 
                          sway the Office of Personnel Management to pursue formal 
                          descriptions. If there were only five or ten GIS personnel 
                          they might not pursue a formal effort. But if there 
                          were 80 or more, the OPM would be inclined to develop 
                          these descriptions. Judge David Hudson asked if there 
                          was not a job audit process by which an agency could 
                          develop a description.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne suggested that this issue be kept on the agenda 
                          and that a draft of descriptions be put together to 
                          move forward on the issue. She asked the AGIO to provide 
                          descriptions from other states. Bill Bush and Earl Smith, 
                          state agency representatives on the Board, volunteered 
                          to serve on a committee to pursue this matter. Suzanne 
                          suggested that Mike McGibbony, also a state agency representative, 
                          might provide additional support.</p>
                        <p>9. New Business<br />
                          Watershed Boundary Delineation &#8211; Earl Smith<br />
                          Earl discussed new Nutrient Surplus Area legislation, 
                          management plan requirements and background status of 
                          the available hydrologic unit data. He stated that the 
                          USGS, NRCS, AGIO and ASWCC were making progress in finding 
                          a solution to defining accurate boundaries for these 
                          areas, but that some issues with coverage resolution 
                          and accuracy exist. The cost of 1:24,000 8-digit watershed 
                          updates and certification by USGS and NRCS is estimated 
                          at $32,000. He further stated that currently no certified 
                          state 1:24,000 hydrologic boundaries exist.</p>
                        <p>Board Committees &#8211; revise and reassign<br />
                          The usefulness and membership of existing committees 
                          were examined and evaluated. The Electronic Plat Filing/Parcel 
                          Mapping Committee and AR Spatial Data Infrastructure 
                          Policies Committee were deactivated. The Funding Committee 
                          responsibilities will be assumed by the Task Force. 
                          New committees include the Task Force for Legislative 
                          Action and State Agency GIS Position Descriptions. See 
                          membership assignments below.<br />
                          <br />
                          Advisory Council membership and participation<br />
                          Suzanne stated that she would like to see the Advisory 
                          Council more closely involved with the Board. She welcomed 
                          the participation of Tracy Moy and Joe Clements at this 
                          meeting. She also suggested that the Board should revisit 
                          membership of the Council, as several representatives 
                          are no longer available to participate.</p>
                        <p>Elections<br />
                          Suzanne Wiley reminded the Board that it was time for 
                          annual elections and opened the floor for nominations 
                          for Chair. Randy Jones nominated Phyllis Smith. Bill 
                          Bush moved that the nominations cease and that Phyllis 
                          be elected by acclamation. Earl Smith seconded the motion. 
                          The motion passed unanimously and Phyllis Smith was 
                          elected Chair of the Board. Nominations were then opened 
                          for Vice-Chair. Phyllis Smith nominated Suzanne Wiley. 
                          Bill Bush moved that nominations cease and that Suzanne 
                          be elected by acclamation. Judge David Hudson seconded 
                          the motion. The motion passed unanimously and Suzanne 
                          Wiley was elected Vice-Chair of the Board.</p>
                        <p>10. Future meeting dates - February / March<br />
                          The Board set February 18th and March 17th as the tentative 
                          meeting dates for the next two months. Board members 
                          are to check calendars for conflicts. Shelby will set 
                          up conference calls for the Task Force on Legislative 
                          Action in the interim.</p>
                        <p>11. Adjournment <br />
                          Following the conclusion of business, a motion to adjourn 
                          was made by Phyllis Smith and seconded by Randy Jones. 
                          The motion passed unanimously. The meeting adjourned 
                          at 12:15 p.m.</p>
