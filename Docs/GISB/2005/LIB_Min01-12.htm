                            <li>Richie Pierce-CAMP-highlights from CAMPcamp: Paid for by Cap grant, hosted in Ferndale, AR. Forty-three people showed up, 35 counties were represented. Attendees enjoyed it and it increased excitement in the counties to get moving with the project. Clay County is getting squared away, almost in GeoStor, about to start phase 2. Same 72 counties showing continuing involvement in CAMP.</li>
                            <li>Vince Guillet - ACF-Benton and Yell added to ACF standard. NO NEW data sine Nov. 10 th. Longest period of no new data, 6-7 counties close to finishing. Working with Howard County on Request For Proposals. White county is getting started. <strong>Q-</strong>Russell Gibson asked if there is a formal process for getting updated files from data providers. Vince stated that we were working on it. Shelby Johnson mentioned that scheduling for the program is challenging, due to the fact that there are no outside financial incentives for county.</li>
                            <li>Learon Dalby - primary project is facilities school map. Building coordinates were captured, Richie and Vince created IMS interface for internet access of school reports. Been working on keeping the IMS up and running, Senator Broadway is involved</li>
                            <li>Kimberly Bogart - The AGIO is working as a data acquisition go between for the counties and the FEMA contractors. Current accomplishments include the acquisition of statewide bridge data and the cross-walking of that data in FEMA&rsquo;s guidelines and standards (G&amp;S). Jefferson Co. roads data layer is being re-aligned to increase accuracy, and the attributes of it and other ACF data are being cross-walked into FEMA G&amp;S. She will attend a FEMA training course on floodplain mapping the week of January 16 th. Yell and Saline county&rsquo;s DFIRMs (Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps) are complete and Kimberly is attempting to obtain that data for input into GeoStor. St. Francis is close to completion. The official list of the order of the counties was issued by FEMA and those interested can contact Kimberly at the AGIO to obtain it.</li>

                          <ul>
                            <li>Shelby Johnson - following (Aug.) meeting, a Request For Proposals (RFP) to update imagery was drawn up (with the aid of state procurement and DFA) and sent out over the course of Nov. and Dec. But, as of now we have canceled the project for this year. Learon Dalby will brief on issues. Nine proposals were received back. The deliverable products ranged from film to digital with a variety of methods used. An AGIO committee reviewed and rated all of the proposals while being guided by the DFA. The committee then reviewed the cost for each proposal and compared proposals on a point system. Sanborn was initially selected. Negotiations were initiated. Confusion within the RFP halted negotiations due pricing concerns. With about 10 days before flying needed to start no contract was in place. The pricing issues remained and the RFP was removed. Learon will re-write the RFP making it a much cleaner and precise document. Hoped to be finished and issued by May to July of 2005, this will leave more time for review of proposals and for negotiations. Cost submitted by vendors was sealed and DFA has urged no revealing of those costs.</li>
                            <li>Questions: </li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>(Russell Gibson &ndash; RG) would this be something to look at as professional services as opposed to lowest bid? <a name="OLE_LINK2" id="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1"> Answer:</a> (Learon Dalby - LD) It was, The point based system of evaluation was used before cost was brought in to the evaluation. </li>
                              <li>(RG)-were costs as expected? Answer: (LD) yes. </li>
                              <li>(Suzanne Wiley - SW) what are we looking for in the next RFP? Answer: (LD) digital sensor with 1 meter state wide and 1 foot for cities over 10,000 with 10 mile buffer (approx.) Elevation desired is 10m dem (7.6m vertical accuracy, 10m cell size statewide) </li>
                              <li>(SW) Potential for buy in program for 1 foot imagery? Answer: (LD) Yes.</li>
                              <li>(RG) New picture for ground control? Answer: (LD) Yes. With digital sensor, second generation will not be used solely as control. Answer: (Shelby Johnson - SJ) limited ground control was questioned and the AGIO committee was satisfied with technical answers given. </li>
                              <li>(RG) was any Lidar data mentioned in the proposals? Answer: (SJ) traditional methodology was listed, no Lidar, some software driven and others analog. Caused large cost differences. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li> Phyllis Smith mentioned that removing the RFP and reissuing it later this year will allow extra time for when considering the next one.</li>
                            <li>Shelby Johnson mentioned that funding was an issue. Putting it together and the logistics associated with that. Time was a factor.</li>
                            <li>Question: </li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>(Brian Culpepper - BC) Pertaining to funding. When is the right time for counties to start allocating money for this project? Answer: (Judge Hudson &ndash; JH) In AUG to SEPT, to put it on the books for them locally. This is the best time because this is when they are making budgeting decisions.</li>

                            <li>They also talked about whether they were still on the right track. They decided that YES they were. </li>
                            <li>Also discussed was the AGIO Budget hearing; panel members would be there to support them. They suggested AGIO develop marketing tool for themselves, photoidentifiable ground control points and elevation data. Mentioned to stay better in touch with advisory panel members. </li>
                            <li>Judge Hudson asked if minutes were available for that meeting, he was unable to attend it. Would like copies of Suzanne Wiley&rsquo;s notes. Phyllis says she will try to get copies out. Earl asked if they could be attached to this meetings minutes</li>

                            <li> Shelby - - working on existing budget from 3 years ago and feels that money is available for official travel for about 3-4 meetings. Travel budget was included in next biennium budget proposal, must wait to see if the budget is approved. If so, info is needed to get each person into ASSIS to allow payment.</li>
                            <li>Phyllis - - asked what does board feel about it. </li>
                            <li>Judge - - subject does not affect him, his travel is provided by his county. </li>

                            <li>Suzanne mentioned that until July it will be removing money from the current AGIO&rsquo;s travel account to pay for the boards travel and she feels that this may hinder the AGIO&rsquo;s travel capability. </li>
                            <li> Shelby - - if new budget is approved as is, there is a line item for board travel. Until then thanks to grants, we have the money to support travel for 3-4 meetings until the new budget comes into effect.</li>
                            <li>Suzanne - - feels that it is more important that the money is used for AGIO not board members, and wondered if the money is not uses can it in turn be returned to the AGIO for their use?</li>
                            <li>Learon - - Yes</li>

                          <ul>
                            <li> Shelby &ndash; passed out legislation proposed by Arkansas Society of Professional Surveyors to change the definition of land surveying. The land surveying community has convened a group to look at the definition of land surveying and they decided it needed revisions. They have compared it to the national model law and made changes to their definition. They then sent it out for comments to surveyors and the GIS community. The document passed out included highlighted changes in the definition. The AGIO spent time reviewing it and after some debate they believe that with one proposed change to the definition of metadata they would agree with the definition as pertains to the GIS community as a whole.</li>
                            <li>The change needed was on pg 2, item C. Metadata shall be understood to mean&hellip;and reference the metadata code enacted by the ASLIB existing already in law. This would remove a possible adverse impact on the GIS community and would help by referring back to our law. </li>
                            <li>Phyllis sent appreciation to Tom Webb in including us in the review process of the changes that surveyors wanted to make and it shows a good level of collaboration with surveyors and GIS for Arkansas.</li>
                            <li>Question: (RG) how does it affect GIS uses of NSDA accuracy et al. Answer: (SJ) no official STAMP or SEAL can be used but accuracy is, and can be, published in the metadata of the files. Re-referencing the ASLIB metadata definition should alleviate any problems. The language in the surveyor&rsquo;s definition was known as unclear but they couldn&rsquo;t offer any specific valid changes. So after questioning the accuracy statement issues to the surveying committee, the AGIO feels that the minor change would appropriately cover the GIS community&rsquo;s interests.</li>
                            <li>Question: (RG) what should and shouldn&rsquo;t be certified by a surveyor? Confusion on what is allowed and or needed as officially certified. Answer: (SJ) His opinion is that the Board of Engineers and Surveyors should be the party to decide. This will only happen if a complaint is actually made, and then we would have to wait for their decision. </li>
                            <li>RG &ndash; The wording of what is a POINT in the definition is too open and could cause problems.</li>
                            <li>Considerable discussion by members and guests including the following: metadata should be well defined. Brian Culpepper mentioned creating a legal disclaimer template for anyone to use to help clean up the accuracy issue for the GIS community. The AGIO has something like this and have been using it for many different purposes. </li>
                            <li> Shelby mentioned that this definition is not law yet and that the AGIO will be tracking this legislation to see where it goes and to make sure that the metadata definition is referenced correctly. <br />

                            <li>Highlights &ndash; moving us to operate out of general revenue as opposed to old way of (onetime general improvement and or capital improvement moneys) will allow us to put in to place some long term programs, staff and travel and training, (Programs &ndash; GEOStor as data processing (hard wired into budget) ACF and ADOP). The 2 nd page shows executive recommendation on these issues. </li>
                            <li>Went through 2 budget hearings and the 2 nd allowed time to answer questions and it ended with a recommendation to pass following the executive recommendation. Something not in the executive recommendation was a staff member to work on educational programs (GeoStor training, metadata training&hellip;) we will still try to find a way to fund this option. </li>
                            <li>Page (89) discuses the GIS fund and the option of seed funding for GeoStor in the amount of $250,000 each year.</li>
                            <li>Two supplemental appropriation requests were sent out for an aerial photo update and those will be sent to the senate. If approved they will become active this budget year and will allow the money to pass into the next year if not spent. This is a good thing! The bill number will be sent to the board so that they can follow if they would like.</li>
                            <li>Question: (Judge Hudson -- JH) He is contacting supporters to promote the AGIO as mentioned at the last meeting and wondered where that went and how he needs to be involved with it, as an individual relationship as opposed to a campaign. He is willing to strengthen his relationships with his locals. Stressed the need to establish a better understanding of focus, goals and objectives of board and AGIO, and to bring the knowledge level down to the level of those we are trying to gain support from. Clear and Simple. </li>

                            <li>SJ &ndash; more than a year ago, panel members questioned the description of GIS users for job description use, and the AGIO looked at several other states examples and created a 4 part break down of job experience levels. It has since been revised down to 3 (technician, specialist, coordinator with a possible step of I and II for specialist). In December, the personnel subcommittee met. Whether it is approved yet is unknown. The AGIO is restructuring their classifications to fit those descriptions. Care was taken so that other states might use our description for themselves.</li>

                            <li>Several members are worried about opening up the code and allowing it to possibly be changed by legislature once it is open. Is it really worth opening it? </li>
                            <li>Suzanne Wiley mentions that this act is a revision of a previous act and that the changes were passed without problems and the lack of mentioning funding in the legislation would not give a reason for the legislation to get rid of the bill as a whole. She feels that the changes in the wording of the full-term vs. replacement positions and the elimination of DIS are important issues and important enough to open the bill. </li>
                            <li> Shelby feels that the administration support (P4 item 3h) issue is currently not correct and that the support comes from the OIT now not DIS.</li>
                            <li>Judge Hudson suggests that the AGIO contact the governor&rsquo;s new Technology Policy Advisor for us about opening up the bill to make these changes for his opinion on this issue.</li>
