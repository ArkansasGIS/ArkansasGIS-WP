                        <p><strong><em>Approval of Minutes</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Approval  of Minutes for December 1, 2004 ASLIB Advisory Panel Meeting:  Phyllis Smith moved to accept the minutes of  the December 1, 2004 ASLIB Advisory Panel Meeting. Fred Limp seconded the  motion. The motion carried.</p>

                        <p>Approval  of Minutes for February 2, 2005 ASLIB Meeting: Phyllis moved to accept the  minutes of the February 2, 2005 ASLIB meeting. Yancey Reynolds seconded the  motion. The motion carried.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Report from State Geographic Information  Coordinator</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby  Johnson, State Geographic Information Coordinator, gave a report:</p>
                        <p><strong>UPDATE ON ADOP II.</strong><br />
                          Currently  AGIO aims to reissue an RFP for ADOP II in late May/early June, in order to  have a contract in place by October/November. Shelby recently returned from the  NSGIC 2005 Midyear Conference where he met a director of cooperative funding  for orthoimagery from USGS, and got a verbal commitment for cooperative funding  from the USGS. This would potentially consist of $200 to $300k on the part of  the USGS. The extensive list of deliverables, dependent upon funding, includes urban  1’ and rural 3m resolution imagery; 10m DEM softcopy; natural color and color  infrared at 1m statewide; and 10m DEM derived from 1m stereoimagery.</p>
                        <p><strong>STATE LEGISLATIVE UPDATE.</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The revision of LIB code was  signed into law as Act 264. </li>
                          <li>Act 1178 changed the state’s  surveyor designation from “registered land surveyor” to “registered  professional surveyor.”</li>
                          <li>Legislative budget  initiatives are all still pending.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE UPDATE</strong><br />
                          The  US House of Representatives recently passed House Resolution 1370 to develop a multipurpose  cadastre to assist with federal real property inventory. NSGIC has not yet  taken a formal position on HR 1370 but one will be forthcoming. </p>
                        <p><strong>UPDATED MOU</strong><br />
                          Shortly  after its creation, the LIB signed an MOU with the FGDC pledging cooperation  with the activities of the NSDI. The National Geospatial Programs Office’s  realignment of the FGDC and other federal components of the NSDI will require a  new, updated MOU, which would involve Russell Gibson, LIB Chair; a  representative of USGS; Shelby Johnson, State Geographic Information  Coordinator; and possibly the Governor. </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Physical Relocation of GeoStor </em></strong></p>
                        <p>The  process of the relocation of the GeoStor infrastructure from Fayetteville to  Little Rock has been undertaken based on the following factors:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>The long-range plans for  GeoStor were that it should be operated by the state and that DIS would be the  best-qualified hosting entity.</li>
                          <li>Given that Sun Microsystems  will no longer be supporting the server as of August, and the recent  intermittent failures of hardware, it would be imprudent to risk future component  failure in light of the importance of GeoStor to the state.</li>
                          <li>The recommendations of Shelby  Johnson, AGIC; Fred Limp, director of CAST; Doug Elkins, ECIO; and Claire  Bailey, director of DIS, are that this is an opportune time to make the  transition. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There  was brief discussion regarding whether the move of GeoStor fell under the  Board’s purview. Shelby asked for the Board’s review and involvement and stated  that it is important for the Board to approve the strategy for relocation  because of the LIB’s ties to AGIO and DIS.</p>
                        <p>Fred  moved that the Board approve the physical relocation of the GeoStor  infrastructure from Fayetteville to DIS. Judge Hudson seconded the motion. The  motion carried.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Software Change in GeoStor</em></strong></p>
                        <p>At  present the AGIO recommends that concurrent with the physical relocation of  GeoStor, it should switch from Oracle to Microsoft SQL Server, and change to an  ESRI interface plus a Safe Software FME data delivery extension repackaged for  ESRI and operating on a Windows platform. Points of consideration presented by  AGIO included the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>There has been a shift in  the market towards using browsers without plug-ins in searching for and  delivering data. Usage reports and familiarity with the Arkansas GIS community  show that ESRI is the predominant GIS software used in the state. </li>
                          <li>Both ESRI and Microsoft have  been contacted regarding the project and neither has reservations about it.  ESRI has committed its support of the project. There has been no formal  commitment from Microsoft. </li>
                          <li>The cost of moving GeoStor  is already substantial because of hardware acquisition. AGIO’s feeling is that  transitioning to new software platforms should not increase the overall cost  significantly. </li>
                          <li>DIS will use existing staff,  restructure its backup system, and work with Dell on equipment design. DIS will  be responsible for operation, hardware maintenance, and system administration.  AGIO will help with building the GIS component of the system and loading the  data. </li>
                          <li>Additional security risks to  the operating system will be addressed by DIS, which has a staff of five people  whose exclusive role is system security.</li>
                          <li>Switching from Oracle to MS-SQL  would restrict direct-connect capability to data custodians who are using ESRI  software. AGIO’s observation is that cities, counties, and state agencies which  are creating framework data and who are the major contributors to uploading are  primarily an ESRI-centric user community. AGIO emphasized that this change will  not affect data delivery, only write-in. </li>
                          <ol>
                            <li>There was discussion  regarding whether direct-connect functionality is a mission of GeoStor. AGIO  states that it has been a long-range objective to facilitate regular data  maintenance. Alternatives to direct connect include submitting data via CD or  an ftp drop site; however, these methods are effectively rewrites of data  rather than data maintenance. </li>
                            <li>AGIO urged the Board to  consider whether direct-connect access is a policy issue, in light of the fact  that the Board already has a data-loading policy which could potentially be  amended to address direct-write capabilities. Switching to Microsoft SQL Server  would eliminate direct-connect capacity for non-ESRI users</li>
                            <li>It was generally agreed that  direct connectivity is a policy issue that LIB should be aware of. No action  was taken.</li>
                          </ol>
                          <li>The Board asked AGIO  representatives how the relocation of GeoStor would affect staffing issues.  AGIO already has the staff it will have through 2007. Fred said that operating  GeoStor currently requires at least one FTE besides the database administrator.  This would mean the current AGIO staff would effectively lose one FTE, especially  during the six- to 18-month transition period. Fred encouraged the AGIO to  consider in what capacity it will be required to step down in order that the user  group will know what to expect.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Judge  Hudson asked whether it would be appropriate for the LIB to have a role in an  MOU between AGIO and DIS regarding the coordination efforts and staff support  the AGIO would be receiving from DIS. Learon Dalby responded that there is already  in place a technical service agreement between AGIO and DIS which outlines the respective  responsibilities of AGIO and DIS. No action was taken. </p>
                        <p>The  Board proposed that Oracle should be approached and given the opportunity to  meet the requirements of AGIO for maintaining GeoStor on an Oracle server. The  AGIO agreed to broach discussion with Oracle regarding the possibility of  Oracle’s meeting their demands. Russell asked AGIO to explore all its  possibilities and come up with the best solution given the existing resources,  and there was general agreement that the presentation of the solution to the  GIS community should be considered. No further action was taken.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Discuss alternative funding sources for ensuring  the statewide completion of the Arkansas Centerline File Program (ACF). </em></strong></p>
                        <p>The  AGIO submitted to the Board a document entitled “Acceleration of the Arkansas  Road Centerline File Program,” outlining three options for managing the disbursal  of a requested $750,000 of State General Revenue Funding for ACF development. The  Board discussed which funding scheme would be the most appropriate allotment of  state funds. </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Option One:  AGIO manages multiple contracts between a  selected list of counties and ACF Feature Vendors. Counties receiving funds  would primarily be those in which at least some ACF data have already been  created.</li>
                          <li>Option Two:  AGIO administers a single contract with the  Feature Vendor able to complete as many counties as funding permits.</li>
                          <li>Option Three:  AGIO administers grant program under which  counties with no ACF data are eligible for matching funds, possibly at a rate  of 80% state: 20% county funds.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>During  general discussion among the Board members the following points and positions  were raised:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>A competitive business  environment for creating ACF data has already been created; choosing a single  vendor as suggested in Option 2 would discount all other certified vendors. </li>
                          <li>Poorer counties may not even  be able to raise the suggested 20% matching funds required to support technical  staff. It is important to extend capabilities to smaller and poorer counties.</li>
                          <li>Counties who are already  creating and maintaining the data should receive state support for their  efforts.</li>
                          <li>The overreaching goal of the  ACF program is to achieve statewide coverage, efficiently and effectively.</li>
                          <li>The program title “Arkansas  Centerline File” or “ACF” may be an obstacle in raising public support for the  project. A title emphasizing its value to public service such as 911 emergency  response would highlight its importance to emergency management coordinators,  sheriffs, and other officials. </li>
                          <li>Successful administration of  a program increases the likelihood of reappropriation in the next funding  cycle. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The  AGIO reminded the Board that under law, the Board can direct available funding  to state projects. Administration of funds received for the acceleration of the  centerline mission is a policy issue that LIB needs to weigh in on. </p>
                        <p>Discussion  focused primarily on the benefits of Option 3. Fred suggested that the Board  charge AGIO with the development of a competitive grant scheme more or less  like Option 3. No action was taken.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Future meeting dates – April/May</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby  suggested that the Board prepare for a meeting via conference call to address  the ACF funding issue and to get updated on the status of GeoStor, and then  meet in person in May. Russell agreed to a teleconference in April and a  physical meeting in May. <br />
                          <strong><br />
