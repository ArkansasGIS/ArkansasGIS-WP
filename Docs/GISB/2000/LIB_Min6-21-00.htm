                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          17th Floor Conference Room, Union Building, in Little 
                          Rock. Minutes from the last meeting of the May 12, 2000, 
                          meeting were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p><u>Project Main</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that school is out for the 
                          summer and almost all the schools that have been participating 
                          in Project Main have returned their data to CAST in 
                          Fayetteville. CAST is working on reassembling and checking 
                          the data. He anticipates the data will be returned in 
                          August.</p>
                        <p><u>GIS Survey</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that data has been arriving and Darla 
                          has been entering it into the database. Survey results 
                          are still arriving and the cutoff date will be the end 
                          of June. The response rate is 32 percent and he was 
                          aiming at a 30 percent response. He described how the 
                          responses are flagged by type of respondent, which will 
                          give good statistical information regarding users of 
                          GIS. He pointed out that many respondents were not aware 
                          of the Board and that it was very important to reach 
                          those people and educate them as to the projects and 
                          activites the Board is promoting or sponsoring.</p>
                        <p><u>Staff Position</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby announced that he is in the process of interviewing 
                          applicants to fill a staff position in his office and 
                          that everything is progressing smoothly regarding this.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3><b>Old Business</b></h3>
                        <p><u>Color Infrared Photography Project</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that she and Shelby met with 
                          Ray Fox and Pixxures at the Mid-America Conference in 
                          Missouri and that they had a very productive meeting. 
                          They identified what the LIB, the USGS, and what Pixxures 
                          needs to do to keep the project moving along. She and 
                          Shelby put together a letter to the NAPP committee in 
                          regard to the leaf-off/leaf-on situation, but there 
                          has been no response as yet. She explained that Pixxures 
                          will need to provide some data for the NAPP committee 
                          to examine in regards to the leaf-on/leaf-off issue, 
                          and Ray Fox has sent Pixxures some examples of NAPP 
                          agreements. Ray Fox has proposed a draft DOQ workshare 
                          agreement and that is going through DIS and the USGS 
                          for comments.</p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the contract people at 
                          DIS have reviewed the workshare agreement and made some 
                          additions to reflect state requirements. He explained 
                          that the agreement is being reviewed in California where 
                          the DOQ project leader is located, which seems to be 
                          delaying the process. Shelby said that Pixxures is coming 
                          into his office to discuss project details on June 23.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Shelby showed examples of the LIDAR photography that 
                          has come back and explained that it will generate a 
                          one-meter DEM, which is very, very good. Suzanne Wiley 
                          explained that one of the holdups in getting the data 
                          processed will be the QA/QC by USGS, but that Ray Fox 
                          was agreeable to the inclusion of one county in the 
                          workshare agreement that will serve as a pilot project 
                          for DOQQ AQ/AC. It will be processed before NAPP approval 
                          and will serve as an example for cooperators and legislators. 
                          She said it looks like the county that will be used 
                          will be Lafayette County, which is one that is completely 
                          photographed. Shelby commented that the selection of 
                          that county was a good strategic choice as Judge Frank 
                          Scroggins, county judge, has interests in GIS; Linda 
                          Sparrow, Lafayette County Assessor, is the chair of 
                          the Arkansas Assessor's Association; this area was photographed 
                          early and there should be no leaf-on issues; and this 
                          is also an area where three project cooperators have 
                          areas under management. Shelby said that Pixxures will 
                          do complete DOQ production for the whole county so that 
                          will be the first completed part of the entire project. 
                          He explained that as the data is processed, it will 
                          come to him and the cooperators in the project will 
                          get copies first.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that the LIDAR flights for the Corps 
                          of Engineers part of the project have all been completed 
                          and the processing is underway.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><u>Department of Highway and Transportation</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that she and Shelby have received 
                          response from Mr. Flowers of the Highway and Transportation 
                          Department and that he named a contact person, Mr. Bill 
                          Durham, to work with the Board. Shelby described some 
                          of the data that the Department will be contributing 
                          and stressed how valuable this information will be. 
                          Shelby has also supplied to the AHTD a list of other 
                          data that will be available in the data warehouse. He 
                          said that there will need to be a technical meeting 
                          to discuss details regarding the transfer of data, which 
                          is in a number of locations and in different formats.</p>
                        <p><u>Surveying Filing System</u></p>
                        <p>Randy Jones explained that he has tried to reach Mike 
                          Hart, the chair of the legislative committee for the 
                          Arkansas Surveyor's Association, but that he has been 
                          unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p><u>Advisory Panel</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley recommended the Board assemble a large 
                          stakeholder's group to include in an introductory workshop, 
                          with the goal of educating them about the efforts of 
                          the Board and of obtaining letters of support for the 
                          Board's legislative efforts from major players with 
                          interests in GIS. She then suggested that groups of 
                          stakeholders who share areas of interest can then nominate 
                          a representative to form a ten-member Advisory Panel 
                          for the Board. Each of the panel members could report 
                          back and receive input from their interest groups. Discussion 
                          continued regarding who to include in various interest 
                          groups and how to contact them. A draft letter that 
                          was prepared by Jubal Smith was passed to members for 
                          comments. Shelby Johnson also passed around a sample 
                          brochure that he proposed to include with the letter 
                          to the prospective stakeholders. Each Board member will 
                          contact an interest group by mail and will follow up 
                          by phone.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The members discussed the logistics of doing a presentation 
                          to a large group of invitees and it was decided that 
                          initially a presentation will be done for the GIS Users 
                          Forum to familiarize that group with the plans of the 
                          Board. The GIS Users Forum members will be asked to 
                          assist in identifying key stakeholders. Phyllis Smith 
                          will arrange this meeting. After the GIS Users Forum 
                          meeting, a large stakeholders meeting will be held in 
                          early September, after the next Land Information Meeting 
                          in August. Suzanne Wiley asked each member to plan to 
                          give a section of the presentation based on their special 
                          interests, current projects and completed projects.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that Ray Fox of the USGS is interested 
                          in forming a federal interest group and would like to 
                          coordinate with the stakeholder's presentation meeting. 
                          An organization of federal partners could possibly bring 
                          additional funding into the state. Ray will attend the 
                          next LIB meeting in July to give an update on the changing 
                          status of the USGS.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley announced that Jubal Smith and Shelby 
                          Johnson will be representing the LIB at the Arkansas 
                          Economic Development Conference. Shelby Johnson will 
                          also be talking more to the Joint Committee on Advanced 
                          Communications and Information Technology in the future.</p>
                        <p><u>Elections</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reminded the members that elections were 
                          held at the last meeting with the reinstatement of current 
                          officers for the coming year. She explained that she 
                          is changing jobs, but that she will still be a representative 
                          from Higher Education and will still be based at U of 
                          A at Monticello. She has contacted the Governor's Office 
                          and informed them of the change.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell moved that the Board carry over the 
                          vote from the last meeting that Suzanne Wiley remain 
                          as chair and Jim Wells remain as vice chair. The motion 
                          was seconded by Phyllis Smith and the vote was unanimous.</p>
                        <p>It was also announced that Dwayne Reel is resigning 
                          from the Board and discussion followed on possible people 
                          to fill that vacancy.</p>
                        <p><u>Future Meetings</u></p>
                        <p>The next meeting was set for July 19, with a meeting 
                          location to be announced. The August 24th meeting will 
                          be held in Little Rock and the proposed visit to U of 
                          A at Monticello will be rescheduled.</p>
                        <p><u>Comments</u></p>
                        <p>Jubal Smith added that he, Shelby, and Shirley Sandlin 
                          will be presenting at the Vision 2010 Economic Development 
                          Seminar on July 14 in Fayetteville. They will cover 
                          SWAG, CAST, MAIN, EAST, and other GIS issues.</p>
                        <p>The business meeting was then adjourned.</p>
                        <h3><b>Strategic Planning Session</b></h3>
                        <p>Following the business meeting, a strategic planning 
                          session was facilitated by Stan Hoessler of Nortel. 
                          Ideas and documentation resulting from this session 
                          will be used in the support of legislation, as well 
                          as the development of stakeholder presentations.
