                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          2nd Floor Conference Room, Ragland Building, in Little 
                          Rock. Minutes from the last meeting of the June 21, 
                          2000, meeting were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p><u>Project Main</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained the final edits for the project 
                          have been completed at CAST. Shelby related that some 
                          areas of the state were not completely verified and 
                          that will be dealt with later.</p>
                        <p><u>GIS Audit</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that the audit has been completed 
                          and is in a database. He will be able to generate detailed 
                          reports and this data will be made available on line. 
                          He estimated a response rate of about 35%. Shelby announced 
                          that he has hired Learon Dalby from the UALR GIS applications 
                          lab as a GIS specialist to support the State Land Information 
                          Coordinator's office. Learon will be taking full responsibility 
                          right away for Project MAIN and for the GIS audit reporting.</p>
                        <p><u>Grant for Aerial Photography Project and GeoStor</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that Don Melton will be assisting 
                          when him in presenting another grant proposal to the 
                          Economic Development Fund Commission for funding for 
                          GeoStor.</p>
                        <h3><b>Old Business</b></h3>
                        <p><u>NAPP and DOQQs</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that there is nothing really 
                          new to report on the NAPP as there is no flying being 
                          done at this time. The innovative partnership has been 
                          finalized and has been submitted to the USGS contracts 
                          office in Reston, with assistance from Ray Fox from 
                          USGS. Shelby said that he has worked with Ray also for 
                          the USGS workshare agreement, which will facilitate 
                          the state acquiring the existing DOQQs and DEMs to be 
                          used in the processing of the color infrared photography 
                          by Pixxures. Ray Fox commented that it was being signed 
                          when he left his office in Missouri and hoped it was 
                          in the mail at the time of the meeting. Shelby said 
                          that he has not received any feedback yet regarding 
                          the innovative partnership, but that he knows it has 
                          been filed.</p>
                        <p><u>Color Infrared Photography Project</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that Pixxures is focusing 
                          on the Corps of Engineers project area and that they 
                          plan delivery of that data on September 15, 2000. This 
                          represents one-foot color DOQQs and LIDAR two-foot coutour 
                          terrain data along the Arkansas River. Shelby pointed 
                          out that this must be delivered by September 30, 2000, 
                          and that Pixxures is in the process of lining up all 
                          the production procedures for scanning, etc., related 
                          to the one-meter CIR DOQQs. He said he has met Mr. Larry 
                          Conte, the Pixxures representative who has been assigned 
                          to be the production manager for the CIR photography, 
                          and that he is impressed with his expertise.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley asked if it would be possible to acquire 
                          a sample of the one-foot color photography prior to 
                          the meeting with the Economic Development Fund Commission 
                          in September and Shelby said that he would ask about 
                          this. Ray Fox asked if Shelby knew when the USGS would 
                          be sent a sample of the data. Shelby said that the Pixxures 
                          representatives will be coming into town for a meeting 
                          to cover updates and coordination and that it will be 
                          discussed at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained to the members that as part of the 
                          requirements of the innovative partnership is that the 
                          state submit a sample of the photography to the NAPP 
                          office for them to inspect so that they have a sense 
                          of how the data is looking.</p>
                        <p><u>Arkansas Highway Department Data Coordination</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reminded the Board of the positive response 
                          from the Director of AHTD regarding sharing data. The 
                          Director has assigned Mr. Bill Durham in the Computer 
                          Services Division to assist Shelby with the project 
                          and in looking at what data the AHTD would consider 
                          contributing. Shelby met with Mr. Durham and others 
                          from the AHTD and they had a very positive discussion. 
                          Shelby will provide a list of items that will be in 
                          GeoStor that would be of benefit to the AHTD. Those 
                          items will be on a list with the items from AHTD that 
                          could be contributed to GeoStor and will pass it up 
                          the management chain in AHTD for approval. Shelby explained 
                          that in the interim, Mr. Durham has retired and that 
                          he is not sure who the new representative will be in 
                          regards to this project, but that he and AHTD representatives 
                          will be meeting again soon.</p>
                        <p><u>Advisory Panel</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the database was not 
                          quite complete and he asked for the members to forward 
                          the missing information as soon as possible. He said 
                          that at this point the count was at 152 major stakeholders. 
                          Suzanne Wiley stressed that it was important to complete 
                          this information so that the project can move forward. 
                          Phyllis Smith discussed the next GIS Users Forum meeting 
                          on August 30. It was decided that the LIB would do a 
                          presentation for the next meeting as practice for the 
                          stakeholder's meeting on September 7.</p>
                        <p>A Stakeholder Presentation Committee was formed consisting 
                          of Shelby Johnson, Randy Jones, Susan Cromwell, Jim 
                          Wells, and Jubal Smith. The committee will meet on August 
                          2nd at 9:30 at the offices of the Department of Information 
                          Systems. The committee will continue planning for the 
                          Stakeholders meeting.</p>
                        <h3><b>Future Meetings</b></h3>
                        <p>The August 23th meeting will be held in Little Rock 
                          and the proposed visit to U of A at Monticello will 
                          be rescheduled. A tentative meeting date for Setpember 
                          was set for the 20th.</p>
                        <h3><b>Comments</b></h3>
                        <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
                        <p>Following the business meeting, Ray Fox from the USGS 
                          gave a presentation to the Board about the U.S. Geological 
                          Survey restructuring and goals for the future.</p>
                        <p>Following Ray Fox's presentation, the Board continued 
                          work on draft legislation to be presented in 2001. It 
                          was decided that the Legislative Committee would meet 
                          to prepare the second draft later in August.
