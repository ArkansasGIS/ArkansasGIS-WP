                        <p>==========================</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 1:00. The minutes 
                          of the last meeting on October 13 were approved with 
                          minor corrections.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report of the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reported that he met with the director 
                          and deputy director of the Assessment Coordination Department 
                          for discussion of cadastral issues. Shelby explained 
                          that he wanted to inform them and get a person to address 
                          these issues and for the Board to study these issues 
                          in terms of cost and alternatives. John Allen, Director 
                          of ACD, said that they support these issues.</p>
                        <p>Shelby said that he and Learon Dalby met with the director 
                          of Arkansas One-Call and visited their facility. They 
                          exchanged ideas and talked about how they could work 
                          together. Shelby recommended that the Board visit the 
                          One-Call center in Conway sometime in the future, combining 
                          a regular Board meeting with a tour of the center.</p>
                        <p>Shelby reported next that a test run had been done 
                          of importing Arkansas Highway Department black and white, 
                          200 dpi aerial photography data of three counties into 
                          GeoStor. This was done to check what would be necessary 
                          to accomplish this type of procedure and to plan for 
                          importing data for all seventy-five counties in the 
                          future.</p>
                        <p><u>GIS Data Fair</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby said that he and Learon Dalby are planning a 
                          GIS Data Fair for December 8th. The Fair will be for 
                          state agencies to get together to look at each other's 
                          projects and share data with the aim of possible coordination 
                          of future projects. Learon is coordinating this event. 
                          The agencies that have agreed to participate so far 
                          are several divisions of the Arkansas Highway Department, 
                          the Department of Game and Fish, the Department of Human 
                          Services, and the Department of Health. Cecil Davis 
                          said that he will arrange for the Department of Arkansas 
                          Heritage to participate also. Shelby explained that 
                          this could possibly become an annual event.</p>
                        <h3><b>Old Business</b></h3>
                        <p><u>Name Tag Committee</u></p>
                        <p>Jubal Smith reported that nice name tags will be made 
                          for each Board member by GIS Day on November 15.</p>
                        <p><u>Federal GIS Users Forum</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reported that she and Learon Dalby had 
                          attended the first meeting of the Arkansas Federal GIS 
                          Users Forum on October 18, which is being organized 
                          by Ray Fox of the USGS. She said that there was good 
                          attendance and the group talked about various possible 
                          cooperative projects. She also reported that she heard 
                          positive comments about the Land Information Board. 
                          The next meeting of this group will be held in Russellville 
                          at the Ozark National Forest offices. They plan to meet 
                          four times a year. Suzanne said that there was discussion 
                          about how to negotiate cooperative efforts amongst federal 
                          agencies, something which can be difficult due to bureaucratic 
                          processes.</p>
                        <p>Learon Dalby explained that the group has requested 
                          a demonstration of GeoStor and a date of January 18th 
                          was tentatively scheduled. He said that Tammy Hocutt 
                          asked about having federal data in GeoStor to make it 
                          available to the public.</p>
                        <p><u>DOQQs</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson reported that six rolls of the one-meter 
                          film have been converted to diapositives, are in Denver, 
                          and have been reviewed. All six rolls are being shipped 
                          to the USGS in Reston where they will undergo NAPP scrutiny 
                          for specs while at the same time the contractor will 
                          start production. The USGS is shipping necessary data 
                          to Pixxures. Shelby foresees Lafayette County being 
                          completed by the end of November.</p>
                        <p><u>Corps of Engineers Project</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby described how he has reviewed two blocks of 
                          film taken of the Arkansas River at the eastern and 
                          western state borders and that there are major problems 
                          with lint and contrast on those films. He has informed 
                          Pixxures and the COE and Block A will definitely be 
                          rejected due to high overexposure on water reflections. 
                          After much discussion between Shelby, Pixxures and the 
                          COE, Pixxures has agreed to return next year and refly 
                          the whole project. They will use strategies to avoid 
                          glint by using the best sun angle, possible polarized 
                          lenses, and possibly using a different film.</p>
                        <p>Shelby next discussed the lint problems that occurred 
                          with the scanning of the film and Pixxures will work 
                          with the scanning contractor to remedy this.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that they discussed flying lower next 
                          year to get better data. He stressed that Pixxures is 
                          working hard to provide a high quality data set and 
                          that the Corps of Engineers has agreed to accept their 
                          data one year later than agreed upon originally.</p>
                        <p>Shelby added that the processing of the LIDAR images 
                          for the project is on schedule and will be delivered 
                          soon.</p>
                        <p>Fred Limp thanked Shelby for doing so much work towards 
                          getting the best possible results from this project. 
                          Suzanne Wiley agreed and also thanked Shelby for his 
                          dedicated work.</p>
                        <p>In regards to completing the photographic flying of 
                          the state, Shelby will be checking with the Air Force 
                          to try to avoid conflicts in flight schedules, since 
                          the photographic flights cannot be done when the Air 
                          Force is holding flight maneuvers.</p>
                        <p><u>Arkansas Society of Professional Surveyors Project</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reported that she and Susan Cromwell, 
                          Learon Dalby and Randy Jones met with Ted Mullinex, 
                          the lobbyist for the ASPS. They worked on the legislation 
                          for electronic plat recording for Ted to take to the 
                          Surveyors for consideration.</p>
                        <p><u>Advisory Panel</u></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley reported that all but one interest group 
                          has named a representative, but not all have yet agreed 
                          to serve. She will be sending out an invitation letter 
                          to all the nominated representatives asking them to 
                          attend a meeting on November 29 from 9:00 to noon in 
                          the Ragland Building conference room. Jim Wells and 
                          Jubal Smith will help with the meeting. This will be 
                          an orientation for the panel representatives and will 
                          cover information about the Board, future plans, and 
                          proposed legislation for the upcoming Legislative Session 
                          in 2001. Shelby, Suzanne and Learon will prepare an 
                          agenda.</p>
                        <p><u>Presentation by Guest Speaker</u></p>
                        <p>Don Melton, Director of the Department of Information 
                          Systems, was introduced. He appeared before the Board 
                          to discuss legislative strategy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Melton explained that GIS issues have great support 
                          in the legislature, but that there will be problems 
                          with competition for funding in the next legislative 
                          session. He outlined some ways the Board might approach 
                          funding issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
