                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          17th Floor Conference Room, Union Building, in Little 
                          Rock. Minutes from the last meeting of the August 23, 
                          2000, meeting were unanimously approved with minor corrections.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley introduced Mr. Chris Boudreaux of the 
                          Conway Corporation as a new member of the Board. She 
                          also expressed her thanks for the hard work the members 
                          put in regarding the Stakeholder's Presentation in September, 
                          which was very successful.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p><u>Economic Fund Development Commission</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson announced that the Land Information 
                          Board and State Land Information Coordinator's Office 
                          were awarded $800,000 by the Economic Development Fund 
                          Commission towards completion of the state DOQQ project.</p>
                        <p><u>State Mapping Workshop</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby invited Learon Dalby to talk about his attendance 
                          at the State Mapping Workshop put on by the USGS in 
                          Rolla, Missouri. Learon explained that the USGS is in 
                          the process of changing from a multi-disciplinary agency 
                          to a single agency, that they will be focusing their 
                          funding on imagery elevation and hydrography. He explained 
                          that Ray Fox will no longer be the representative for 
                          Arkansas and the new representative will be Mark Coppersmith. 
                          Learon commented that he learned other states are watching 
                          the Pixxures and the color infrared photography project 
                          here in Arkansas. He also described how Arkansas will 
                          be asked to be more involved in MAGIC in the future.</p>
                        <p>Shelby said that a presentation was given on the National 
                          Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) in which it was stated 
                          that Arkansas is the only state with an innovative partnership, 
                          but that this hasn't actually been confirmed by the 
                          USGS at the time of the State Mapping Workshop.</p>
                        <p><u>NSGIC Meeting</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby said that he attended the recent NSGIC meeting 
                          where representatives from the Executive Office of the 
                          President's Office of Management and Budget expressed 
                          interest in the technologies and framework project. 
                          Also, the FGDC has sponsored projects in the past to 
                          finance NSDI with focus of federal money on framework 
                          issues. The OMB will be revising the A-16 circular to 
                          reflect changes. Shelby added that NSGIC will be working 
                          with each state and its coordinator to achieve goals 
                          and then will go to federal agencies to coordinate for 
                          state needs.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that NSGIC has adopted a resolution 
                          to get the federal government to implement NSDI as no 
                          one is accountable for other layers nationally. Shelby 
                          commented that he had a chance to network and learned 
                          that Arkansas is ahead of other states in terms of coordination 
                          of GIS issues in some areas and behind other states 
                          in other areas. He has returned from the conference 
                          with new ideas to consider for use in Arkansas.</p>
                        <p>Shelby added that the NSGIC conference next year will 
                          be in St. Louis and recommended that all the Board members 
                          try to attend.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley added that Ray Fox of the USGS is organizing 
                          a federal GIS users group for the state and will be 
                          setting up an email discussion list for those interested 
                          in joining.</p>
                        <h3>Old Business</h3>
                        <p><u>Color Infrared Photography Project</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson discussed his trip to Ohio to view the 
                          films being processed. He explained that two issues 
                          have been raised regarding the photography project:</p>
                        <blockquote> 
                          <blockquote> 
                            <p>1. Late flights</p>
                            <blockquote> 
                              <p> · NAPP specs set last flights at March 31 and 
                                some of the films were taken up to three days 
                                later, raising leaf-on issues</p>
                              <p> · The NAPP representative, Pixxures &amp; Shelby 
                                review those films and the leaf situation was 
                                seen to be no problem</p>
                              <p> · There were some flightlines too dark and they 
                                will be rejected</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>2. Water - how does the USGS evaluate flooding?</p>
                            <blockquote> 
                              <p> · The NRCS and FSA prefer completely dry land 
                                but this is impossible</p>
                              <p> · If it is impossible to find the boundaries 
                                of a field due to water, the film will be rejected</p>
                            </blockquote>
                          </blockquote>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Shelby said that there are a full 20 rolls for diapositives 
                          to be processed. Lafayette County will be the first 
                          with film being sent to the USGS and the diapositives 
                          being sent to the scanning contractor. Planning is in 
                          the works for the next flight to finish the incomplete 
                          areas from the previous flights.</p>
                        <p><u>NAPP</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that the USGS has approved one-half 
                          of the NAPP flight costs under the innovative partnership 
                          arrangement. The paperwork will be completed next week. 
                          Funding will be $203,194. The workshare agreement is 
                          signed but there is no delivery yet of government materials.</p>
                        <p><u>Plat Filing Project</u></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush said that he has visited with Ted Mullinex 
                          regarding the Surveyors Association Plat Filing project. 
                          Ted is preparing legislation for the Association which 
                          will be sent to the Governor's Office. Susan Cromwell, 
                          Suzanne Wiley and Randy Jones will meet with Mr. Mullinex 
                          about these plans on October 19th.</p>
                        <p><u>Advisory Panel</u></p>
                        <p>Shirley Sandlin said that she needs some instructions 
                          and help regarding local government representatives 
                          on the advisory panel. Susan commented that Mayor Stewart 
                          Nelson of Morrilton supports the Board in all efforts. 
                          Suzanne Wiley brought up the possibility of expanding 
                          the list of panel representatives to include other specific 
                          areas such as natural resources, two- and four-year 
                          schools and K-12 schools, transportation, surveyors, 
                          engineers and land develoment. Shirley Sandlin said 
                          that she has had feedback from city and county stakeholders 
                          requesting separate representation on the panel. Discussion 
                          followed and it was decided that 12-15 members was a 
                          workable number of members for the panel and that the 
                          members should represent interest groups, not special 
                          interests. Suzanne Wiley will write a letter to prospective 
                          panel members and will set up a meeting.</p>
                        <p><u>Legislation</u></p>
                        <p>The most recent draft of 914 legislation edits from 
                          a previous board meeting was reviewed and discussion 
                          ensued. Shirley Sandlin made a motion to accept the 
                          revised version with the deletion of Section 28, (e)(4) 
                          and Section 29 (a)(4), along with slight modification 
                          of Section 29 (g) and (j). The motion was seconded and 
                          passed unanimously.</p>

                        <p><u>GIS Day</u></p>
                        <p>The upcoming GIS Day was discussed and Bill Bush made 
                          a motion to request that the Governor issue a proclamation 
                          observing this event for the state, as he did last year. 
                          Shirley Sandlin seconded the motion and it was unanimously 
                          approved by the Board. Bill Bush will fill out the forms 
                          and send them to the Governor's Office.</p>
                        <p>There was further discussion regarding the possibility 
                          of exhibits or some kind of presentation at the Capitol 
                          on GIS Day.</p>
                        <p><u>Presentation</u></p>
                        <p>Guests Rusty Myers of the West Arkansas Planning &amp; 
                          Development District, Mike Garner of Westark Community 
                          College, and Merrill Keith of the Van Buren Chamber 
                          of Commerce were introduced. Rusty spoke at length about 
                          the efforts being made to coordinate GIS projects in 
                          their part of the state. He explained that they were 
                          approaching the Board for advice and direction in the 
                          development of community-wide GIS. Rusty said that Shelby 
                          Johnson and Learon Dalby of the State Land Coordinator's 
                          Office have been of assistance. Rusty will be establishing 
                          a local chapter of the state GIS Users Forum and is 
                          working with Phyllis Smith regarding this. He said that 
                          he is excited about the color infrared photography project 
                          and the GeoStor project and that he is recommending 
                          that local legislators support LIB funding for these 
                          two important projects.</p>
                        <p>Mike Garner spoke briefly regarding Westark Community 
                          College's planned GIS program and that they are in the 
                          process of doing an assessment as to course curriculum. 
                          This will be a two-year program with an additional one-year 
                          certificate program.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley asked Rusty if they could document the 
                          development process in their area in order to share 
                          it as a model with other areas of the state.</p>
                        <p>Bill Bush made the motion that the Board send a letter 
                          to show support for the GIS coordination efforts being 
                          made by Rusty, Mike and Merrill; Fred Limp seconded 
                          the motion and the Board approved the motion unanimously. 
                          Suzanne Wiley will draft a letter for this purpose.</p>
                        <p><u>Technology Summit</u></p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell reminded the members of the upcoming 
                          IT Summit to be held in Little Rock on November 8th. 
                          She explained that the Governor will address the conference. 
                          She also said she will arrange for the Board to receive 
                          invitations to attend.</p>
                        <h3>Future Meetings</h3>
                        <p>It was decided the next meeting will be held on November 
                          1 from 1:00 to 5:00.</p>
