                        <h3>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</h3>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that he had attended the ASPM 
                          American Congress on Surveying and Mapping Conference 
                          on March 22 to sit on a panel discussion for Arkansas 
                          Surveying and Geospatial</p>
                        <p>Issues, along with Kit Carson from Arkansas Highway 
                          &amp; Transportation Department, Ivan Hoffman, President 
                          of the Arkansas Society of Professional Surveyors and 
                          Charlie Storey from the U.S. Forest Service.&nbsp; He 
                          said the discussion went well, and pointed out that 
                          some other presenters at the conference included Mike 
                          Mitchell, representatives from Intergraph and ESRI, 
                          and that the major vendors were there.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Project Main</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson said that this project is finally underway 
                          and that he has been planning this for about eight months. 
                          He explained that MAIN stands for Mapping Arkansas' 
                          Information Network and that it involves EAST program 
                          participants mapping government facility locations statewide.&nbsp; 
                          The primary purpose is to assist the Department of Information 
                          Systems, as the supplier of public network service in 
                          the state, to utilize this as a resource tool for planning 
                          growth of the public network.&nbsp; The project is just 
                          underway, with 58 high schools participating. </p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that in conjunction with the project, 
                          he had had the opportunity to meeting with Arkansas 
                          One Call and that they are very interested in the work 
                          of the Board.&nbsp; He recommended that the Board should 
                          consider including a One Call representative in the 
                          membership of the proposed Board advisory committee, 
                          as they are major users of GIS across the state. </p>
                        <p>He commented that he continues to make presentations 
                          at meetings and functions and that he talks about the 
                          Land Information Board and that this is ongoing.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong><em>GIS Audit </em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the audit is moving forward 
                          and the development is going well.&nbsp; There will 
                          be a web-based audit and a mailing will be done in the 
                          next several weeks.&nbsp; The results will be compiled 
                          in a database for analysis of GIS resources in the state.&nbsp; 
                          This information will also serve to support legislation 
                          in the next session.&nbsp; He explained that this is 
                          a replica of the FGDC survey that was done in 1996, 
                          with the inclusion of addressing flood plain information.&nbsp;

                        <p><strong><em>American Congress of Survey and Mapping 
                          Conference Report </em></strong></p>
                        <p>Randy Jones reported that the attendance was good and 
                          that the meeting was a success.&nbsp; He said that the 
                          exhibit hall was nice and that all the major vendors 
                          were represented.&nbsp; Shelby attended and participated 
                          on a panel on Arkansas issues.&nbsp; He discussed the 
                          Land Information Board and some of its goals.&nbsp; 
                          Shelby explained that he was unable to attend any of 
                          the other presentations.&nbsp; He went on to comment 
                          that he did learn that the Arkansas Highway and Transportation 
                          Department is putting up some new CORE (continuously 
                          operating reference) stations and one will be in Monticello, 
                          which he believes it will be available to the public.&nbsp; 
                          This is a GPS base station that broadcasts its corrected 
                          signal on an FM frequency, allowing public use of the 
                          signal at no cost.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p><em><strong>GTI Planning</strong></em></p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell explained that the director of DIS has 
                          decided to not request Nortel's services for creating 
                          a network services architecture as the resources to 
                          develop that architecture already exists with the Land 
                          Information Board, Project Main, and DIS Engineering.&nbsp; 
                          Work that has been done in the Nortel sessions with 
                          all the communities of interest has resulted in a lot 
                          of valuable collaboration and identification of issues 
                          and this information needs to be delivered to the DIS 
                          engineers.&nbsp; The LIB next should try to wrap up 
                          its strategic plan together with some technical emphasis 
                          around the impact on bandwidth and the state network.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Old Business &nbsp; </h3>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley next brought up the subject of the LIB 
                          web page and made suggestions regarding possible changes 
                          to improve information presentation.&nbsp; Members were 
                          invited to submit anything that they would like to see 
                          used to augment the current web pages. </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Arkansas Digital Ortho Photography Program</strong></em><u> 
                          </u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson talked about the status of the color 
                          infrared photography project.&nbsp; He explained that 
                          the project is being handled in three phases:&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li> 
                            <p>Flying for the statewide one-meter NAPP </p></li>
                          <li> 
                            <p>Processing to create DOQs </p></li>

                            <p>High-resolution project one-foot color photography 
                              and LIDAR for high resolution terrain </p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The funding for Phase One was promised and secured 
                          from the Governor's Office to DIS.&nbsp; Next was the 
                          start of a fund raising effort to bring in cooperators 
                          in state agencies, federal agencies and the private 
                          sector, and to seek a grant from the Arkansas Economic 
                          Development Fund Commission.&nbsp; The grant application 
                          was to seek funding to cover the entire balance of the 
                          project, all three phases, plus the Geostore operational 
                          startup costs plus staffing for the office, for a total 
                          of $4.1 million.&nbsp; Supporting funds were sought 
                          from other sources and listed in the grant proposal 
                          as a demonstration that it is a valuable project, it 
                          is statewide, and it does impact the bottom line on 
                          the state's ability to bring in industry and commerce, 
                          as the grant fund's specific role is for job creation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>On March 8, Suzanne Wiley and Shelby Johnson, along 
                          with Alan McVey, Deputy Director of ADED, made the presentation 
                          for the grant fund.&nbsp; $100,000 was awarded from 
                          that grant fund to apply towards the project.&nbsp; 
                          The Phase One request was for $779,000, which would 
                          have covered the balance of processing on the statewide 
                          one-meter flight.&nbsp; To date, over $250,000 has been 
                          raised from private sector companies, such as Weyerhauser, 
                          International Paper, the Ross Foundation, etc.&nbsp; 
                          A few county judges are also participating in covering 
                          some funding, and the Corps of Engineers is contributing 
                          $50,000 to the statewide one-meter processing.&nbsp; 
                          All of this funding applies only to the statewide one-meter 
                          phase.&nbsp; To date, the project is $500,000 to $600,000 
                          short of covering all the processing costs for Phase 
                          Two. </p>
                        <p>The contract with the vendor is that payment terms 
                          are stretched out so that some of the funding may run 
                          into the next fiscal year.&nbsp; At this point, though, 
                          funding is not an issue as it stands at this time.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley added that the Economic Development Commission 
                          Fund did invite the LIB back in September to look more 
                          closely at the project.&nbsp; She commented that what 
                          the LIB wanted to do was not a normal type of project 
                          that are ordinarily presented to the Commission and 
                          a couple of the members considered this project to be 
                          too complicated, but that several members were very 
                          supportive.&nbsp; She feels there is a good chance to 
                          obtain more funding with better preparation.&nbsp; Shelby 
                          explained that the Commission has requested more material 
                          to explain what the LIB is and who the members are.&nbsp; 
                          He is working on compiling information for this purpose 
                          and has an outline for putting this information together 
                          for the meeting with the Commission in the fall.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby expressed his thanks to Mike Mitchell for assisting 
                          with the meeting with forestry industry representatives, 
                          which is where the majority of private sector funding 
                          was obtained.&nbsp; A funding request was also presented 
                          to Arkansas One Call, who is interested but noncommittal.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby next showed the members a map of the state showing 
                          areas that have already been photographed, and he explained 
                          the flight procedures.&nbsp; He explained that the weather 
                          has been a major problem and there have been only six 
                          good weather days for flying over a six-week period 
                          of time, and this has resulted in only 40 percent flight 
                          coverage as of this meeting.&nbsp; Another limiting 
                          factor is the NAPP specification of a 30 degree sun 
                          angle to eliminate shadows, which means that no photography 
                          can be done in the early morning or late afternoon.&nbsp; 
                          Another limiting factor was the statewide snowfall in 
                          January which totally prohibited photography based on 
                          NAPP specs.&nbsp; Shelby explained that the trees are 
                          leafing out and this raises questions as to whether 
                          to continue photography with leaf on, particularly in 
                          relation to major funding by the forestry industries, 
                          who requested leaf-on photography from the start.&nbsp; 
                          He pointed out that it is the decision of the Board 
                          whether to continuing the flight into the leaf-on season.&nbsp; 
                          This will result in a mismatch in some of the data in 
                          that some areas will have leaves and others will not.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that Phase Two consists of the data 
                          processing, and the data will be delivered in a compressed 
                          format.&nbsp; Phase Three was to consist of sections 
                          of high resolution photography in certain municipal 
                          areas, but he was initially forced to pull that phase 
                          due to lack of funding.&nbsp; However, the Corps of 
                          Engineers is going to fully fund high resolution photography 
                          for a mile and a half on either side of the Arkansas 
                          River from the Oklahoma border to the Mississippi border.&nbsp; 
                          This will be one-foot color and LIDAR high resolution 
                          photography and will include several city boundaries.&nbsp; 
                          The data provided from this phase will be available 
                          for public access.&nbsp; Shelby made the suggestion 
                          that a letter be sent to the Corps of Engineers thanking 
                          them for their support of this phase of the project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby pointed out that with the exception of the Game 
                          and Fish Commission and DIS, no other state agencies 
                          have elected to participate in the project at this time.&nbsp; 
                          He explained that with the end of the fiscal year, there 
                          may be some more state agencies who will have funds 
                          to use and they may choose to participate.&nbsp; He 
                          added that no federal agencies have chosen to participate 
                          at this point in time.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Shelby explained that if the flight 
                          was continued in areas where people have cooperated 
                          in funding efforts, at the very least none of the cooperators 
                          will be disappointed in what is accomplished. </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Society of Professional Surveyors </em></strong></p>
                        <p>Randy Jones explained that the legislative committee 
                          for the Arkansas Society of Professional Surveyors met 
                          and are looking for projects for the next legislative 
                          session.&nbsp; Ted Mullinex, a consultant, is going 
                          to be working on these projects to prepare a funding 
                          request for this project.&nbsp; One project is Act 645, 
                          the filing act for surveyors requiring all surveyed 
                          plats to be filed in the county and in the office of 
                          the State Land Surveyor.&nbsp; What the ASPS wants to 
                          do is have a web-based filing structure, eliminate the 
                          requirements for filing in the counties, and do it at 
                          a statewide level over the internet.&nbsp; This would 
                          be administered by the State Land Surveyor, who is supportive 
                          of the idea.&nbsp; There would be filing fees for filing 
                          plats through the Land Surveyor's office and possibly 
                          the LIB and DIS could have a portion of the fees for 
                          administration of the process.&nbsp; Randy proposed 
                          that DIS be approached to see if they would be interested 
                          and if they are not, then an outside consultant be sought 
                          to operate it.&nbsp; The timeframe is for this project 
                          would be the summer of 2000.&nbsp; Susan Cromwell that 
                          this would be a great opportunity as a digital signature 
                          pilot project for the state.&nbsp; Suzanne Wiley pointed 
                          out that there also will be privacy issues in regards 
                          to this project and other GIS projects of this type. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell made a motion that Randy Jones establish 
                          a relationship with the Society of Professional Surveyors' 
                          legislative committee to allow the LIB to provide support 
                          and guidance towards the development of a web-based 
                          survey filing system.&nbsp; Phyllis Smith seconded the 
                          motion and it was approved unanimously by the members.&nbsp; 
                        </p>
                        <p><em><strong>Steering Committee </strong></em></p>
                        <p>The members discussed further the topic of potential 
                          members for an LIB steering committee, and then table 
                          this topic for the next meeting. </p>
                        <h3>Committee Reports </h3>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley stressed that the Legislative Committee 
                          really needs to get going, and that the Audit and Inventory 
                          Committee is progressing well.&nbsp; There was discussion 
                          and suggestions about where the Funding Committee could 
                          be looking for grants and grant deadlines for funding 
                          to help support LIB projects.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>Suzanne suggested that the members continue work on 
                          strategic planning as it would be good to have a plan 
                          completed for the legislative package and to present 
                          to the Economic Development Fund members.&nbsp; </p>
