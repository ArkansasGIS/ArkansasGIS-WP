      <p>&nbsp;----------------&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The meeting was called to order at 1:00 p.m. in the Ragland Building 
        2nd Floor Conference Room, Little Rock, Arkansas.Â  Approval of minutes 
        from the last meeting of December 15 was postponed until the next meeting. 
      </p>
      <p>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</p>
      <p>NAPP</p>
      <p>Shelby Johnson reported that there are three planes in the state and 
        that Pixxures has chosen to utilize another subcontractor for flying, 
        Northwest Geomatics. He explained that Northwest Geomatics has a better 
        reputation for producing a consistent product and that he is glad to have 
        that company in the state.</p>
      <p>Shelby reported that Lt. Col. Brian Roberts, Air Commander for the U.S. 
        Air Force Base at Ft. Smith and controller for military operation areas, 
        has agreed to hold down flight missions in the state on the days that 
        the NAPP flights are being flown. That is important because it cost two 
        days of good flying last year. Shelby said his office as sent a thank 
        you letter to Lt. Col. Roberts. </p>
      <p>Shelby went on to explain that the NAPP office of the USGS in Reston 
        has totally cleared out all other NAPP project backlog, so all of the 
        Arkansas film has been QC'd and the reports are being sent. He said that 
        everything will be in hand to refly for this year. Furthermore, as soon 
        as film comes in from the current flights, it can go to the contractor 
        to be miniprinted, titled and labled, and can go right to Reston for QC 
        for this year, and Arkansas is first in the queue. Shelby added that Learon 
        is keeping the ADOP web page current on the status of the project.</p>
      <p>Shelby said that one other major thing that was accomplished before the 
        current mission started was that the flight plan has been reduced by about 
        128 frames. He explained that there was a section of the flight plan that 
        extended into Missouri and all of those frames were taken off the project 
        and that helps the contractor.</p>
      <p><b>ADOP and DOQQ</b></p>
      <p>Shelby Johnson reported that during QA/QC of the Lafayette film, Learon 
        found three problem areas and the film was sent back. He said that the 
        contractor has been working on what was essentially a color-balance problem. 
        The contractor has resolved two out of the three and the third problem 
        occured in the middle of water, so those files will be used unless they 
        come up with some other way of improving them. </p>
      <p>Shelby went on to talk about delivery of the USGS DOQQs, which has the 
        header and metadata, and explained that those files for Lafayette County 
        are in production. The DOQQs will come to the state and the masters will 
        be copied, then the originals will be forwarded to Rolla, Missouri, where 
        they are awaiting to start inspecting those files.</p>
      <p>On the Arkansas River Project, Shelby reminded the Board that all the 
        film that was flown last season was rejected. He said that the reflight 
        of the river corridor has nearly been completed for this year and the 
        initial film looks very good. That film will go right into processing 
        to turn that dataset around as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>On the LIDAR production, Shelby explained that a number of problems have 
        been encountered with the way the data was processed originally with the 
        contractor who captured the LIDAR data. Shelby said they are having to 
        reprocess all of the LIDAR data in order to produce the vector contours. 
        That process is moving forward and the contractor hopes to have that completed 
        by April and deliver both the DEM data and vector contours. Shelby explained 
        that the Corps of Engineers has been great to work with on this and that 
        they have been very understanding regarding the complications that have 
        been encountered in the project.</p>
      <p><b>Arkansas One-Call</b></p>
      <p>Shelby encouraged the Board members to not miss the next meeting at Arkansas 
        One-Call in Conway as there are some good possibilities for some cooperative 
        projects with them. Shelby said that One-Call brings to the table a unique 
        field force of over 100 personnel around the state and that they are considering 
        equipping their personnel with GPS to look at database updates, with a 
        major goal to create a current and up-to-date base map and to get away 
        from utilization of GDT base map data. He said that they're actually talking 
        about collecting address ranges and street center lines as a part of their 
        work, which would be of great benefit.. </p>
      <p><b>Digital Parcel Mapping</b></p>
      <p>Suzanne Wiley welcomed Don Melton, Director of the Arkansas Department 
        of Information Systems, for a general discussion of a possible digital 
        parcel mapping project. Following the discussion, it was decided that 
        the Board needs to supply Mr. Melton with the following information prior 
        to any consideration of drafting legislation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Is it feasible? </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>How long would it take? </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>How much would it cost to create and maintain?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shelby Johnson will do research towards providing answers for Mr. Melton. 
      </p>
      <p><b>GeoStor</b></p>
      <p>Fred Limp reported that GeoStor is up and working, and there have been 
        2000+ downloads and the pace is picking up dramatically. There was an 
        instance of one user attempting to download all the data layers for the 
        state at one time, which caused problems. The system will be adjusted 
        to prevent this in the future. </p>
      <p>Future Meetings&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The next meeting is scheduled for February 
        14, 9-noon, at the Arkansas One-Call Office in Conway, with a tour of 
        the facility after the meeting. </p>
      <p>The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
