                        <p>&nbsp;----------------&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          DIS 3rd Floor Conference Room, MAC Building, One Capitol 
                          Mall, Little Rock, Arkansas.  Minutes from the last 
                          meeting of November 1 were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</strong></h3>
                        <p><strong><em>Data Fair</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that his office hosted a GIS 
                          Data Fair on December 8 for state agencies.  There were 
                          seven or eight different agencies that presented and 
                          a total attendance from about 35 different agencies 
                          .  He explained that he would like to do this once or 
                          twice a year as a way to share information about agency 
                          projects&nbsp;GIS and Fire Meeting  Shelby next outlined 
                          a meeting scheduled for later in the day.  He explained 
                          that there are a number of projects going on in the 
                          state that relate to fire issues and it became clear 
                          to him that he needed to put together a coordination 
                          meeting to share information across the projects and 
                          see whether there are common issues and data.  &nbsp;</p>
                        <h3><strong>Old Business</strong></h3>
                        <p><strong><em>GIS Day</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley next talked about GIS Day.  She said 
                          there was a lot of participation from exhibitors and 
                          there was a steady flow of visitors to the exhibit in 
                          the Capitol and that it was successful.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Advisory Panel</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that the Advisory Panel meeting 
                          went very well.  There was a lot of good discussion 
                          and comments by the panel members.  She said that the 
                          panel members were given a short version of the GIS 
                          Stakeholder's presentation and that Shelby and Learon 
                          put together a nice folder with handouts and maps and 
                          the Board's legislative information.  Everybody was 
                          very supportive and the meeting was successful.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><em>WAPPD Support</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that she is waiting for some information 
                          from Rusty Myers as to who the Board should sent a letter 
                          of support for the WAPPD.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><em>NAPP and DOQ Project</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the first data has arrived 
                          and is all of Lafayette County.  Learon Dalby has done 
                          a quick example comparison by downloading AHTD road 
                          out of GeoStor for Stamps, Arkansas, and then pulled 
                          up the Stamps' DOQ to compare line work, and it all 
                          looked very good based on this cursory assessment.  
                          Fred Limp said that he could get some of the data, he 
                          would get it up on GeoStor as a demo.  Shelby said that 
                          the first thing he has to do is get the data out to 
                          the cooperators and he is reluctant to do that until 
                          they have had a chance to really do some QA/QC.  &nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Electronic Plat Filing Project</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Bill Bush explained that nothing has been done as far 
                          as filing the bill.  He said that they were proposing 
                          to have one county in each congressional district to 
                          request funding for electronic filing.  They have not 
                          picked the counties yet.  He is not sure where the bill 
                          stands at this point.  Shelby Johnson explained that 
                          Ted was trying to get an idea of project costs and that 
                          this would be difficult without doing a thorough analysis.  
                          Bill said that he is not aware of exactly what the ASPS 
                          is proposing, so he can't give Ted any information regarding 
                          costs at this point.  </p>
                        <p>Susan Cromwell asked what it would take to do a requirements 
                          document and the costs could be figured out, so that 
                          the bill could move forward.  She also said that she 
                          understood that the intent was to propose that surveyors 
                          quit having to file in every county, use the Geological 
                          Commission archives electronically, and file with state 
                          only once.  Bill Bush agreed that this is the ultimate 
                          goal.  Susan said that Ted was going to propose amendments 
                          to change that process.  Bill said that Ted had not 
                          said whether this was to be a fee-based budget or whether 
                          they were going to ask for appropriations from some 
                          other revenue.  </p>
                        <p>Susan said she will contact Ted Mullinex and find out 
                          what is happening at this point.&nbsp;Suzanne Wiley 
                          recommended a pilot project rather than trying to do 
                          the whole project at once.  Bill Bush explained that 
                          he does not have enough staff at this time to support 
                          a statewide electronic filing project.  Suzanne stated 
                          that the surveyor's group needs to make a decision as 
                          to what they want before anyone else can follow up on 
                          the cost or staff.  </p>
                        <p><strong><em>Legislation</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley explained that there is an issue regarding 
                          the cadastral definition in the legislation.  Shelby 
                          Johnson explained that at the Advisory Panel meeting, 
                          Joe Clements of the State Board of Registration for 
                          Surveyors attended and there was a considerable amount 
                          of discussion about cadastre and digital cadastre.  
                          He said that it became very apparent at that meeting 
                          that if the Board is not very careful in the way that 
                          the cadastral language is crafted in the legislation, 
                          it could cause problems, as happened in California and 
                          North Carolina.  Shelby started looking at the definition 
                          in the legislation to prevent it from potentially being 
                          confused with surveying.  He worked on the definition 
                          with Fred Limp and then sent the definition to the Arkansas 
                          Society of Professional Surveyor's Board to get input.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Shelby said that the proposed change states:  &quot;It does 
                          not represent legal property boundary descriptions nor 
                          is it suitable for boundary determination of the individual 
                          parcels included in the cadastre.&quot;  He said that the 
                          ASPS has made this suggested change and he thinks that 
                          the definition now will not cause any conflict.  &nbsp;Suzanne 
                          Wiley said that Tom Webb sent some suggested changes 
                          and input and that he was concerned about the submission 
                          of metadata by state agencies.  She said that in the 
                          proposed legislation, a section had been deleted stating 
                          that the Board would require a data quality report with 
                          data submission.  She said that the requirement for 
                          a data quality report could be left in the legislation 
                          and that changes could be made to the digital cadastre 
                          definition.  </p>
                        <p>Discussion followed regarding the proposed changes 
                          to legislation.  Following discussion, Susan Cromwell 
                          made the motion to accept the changes to the legislation, 
                          Bill Bush seconded the motion, and the motion was passed.  
                          Shelby Johnson said he will send the proposed changes 
                          to the ASPS surveryors to keep them informed.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Appropriation Bill</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley passed around copies of the appropriation 
                          request compiled by Shelby Johnson.  Discussion followed.  
                          Shelby explained that the document could be used to 
                          answer any questions posed to Board members regarding 
                          the appropriation request.  &nbsp;<br />
                          <em><strong><br />
                          </strong></em> <strong><em>Legislative Strategy</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that hopefully next week Don Melton 
                          would inform the Board if the Governor will be supporting 
                          the Board's efforts.  If so, the Board can move forward 
                          as instructed; if not, then the Board can make its own 
                          plans.  It was agreed that the Board really couldn't 
                          do anything until after hearing from the Governor's 
                          Office.  &nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Annual Report</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley passed out copies of the Annual Report 
                          of the Board for comments, and said that the Report 
                          will be filed with Legislative Audit prior to the due 
                          date.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Advisory Panel Letter</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley said that she has drawn up a sample letter 
                          to give to the members of the Advisory Panel that they 
                          can use to distribute to GIS stakeholders, who in turn 
                          can use the letters to send to legislators seeking support 
                          for the GIS legislation.</p>
