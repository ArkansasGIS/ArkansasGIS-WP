                        <p>----------------</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to order at 9:00 a.m. in the 
                          17th Floor Conference Room, Union Building, in Little 
                          Rock. Minutes from the last meeting of the July 19, 
                          2000, meeting were unanimously approved.</p>
                        <h3><b>Report from the State Land Information Coordinator</b></h3>
                        <p><u>Project Main</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the data has all been 
                          quality checked and recompiled. It will be now be separated 
                          by contributors and the data will be sent to each special 
                          interest group. Learon Dalby will work on that project.</p>
                        <p><u>GIS Audit</u></p>
                        <p>Learon Dalby is finalizing a report of the first 15 
                          questions on the Audit. Some of the material will be 
                          used for the upcoming Stakeholder Meeting.</p>
                        <p><u>Arkansas Economic Development Conference</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that he and Learon had a booth 
                          at the Economic Development Conference with quite a 
                          bit of traffic. He and Jubal Smith gave workshops on 
                          economic development and GIS, and also presented information 
                          about the Board and the Geostor project. On the last 
                          morning of the conference, Barbara Pardue, Director 
                          of the Department of Economic Development, gave a presentation 
                          and in that presentation, she mentioned GeoStor as an 
                          important project to assist economic development. Jubal 
                          Smith added that both sessions they gave were well attended.</p>
                        <h3><b>Old Business</b></h3>
                        <p><u>NAPP and DOQQs</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson said that there had been a major planning 
                          meeting with the vendor. He explained that 28 rolls 
                          of film have been exposed; one roll has been rejected, 
                          two rolls were deemed to be dark, four rolls of film 
                          were light, and 20 rolls film are at HAS in Dayton, 
                          Ohio. He reminded the the members that there had been 
                          some flights after March 31, which was the spec date 
                          by USGS. There were flights on April 4, 5, 6, and 11 
                          in an attempt to finish the project and which was not 
                          successful. USGS was made aware of that issue and they 
                          said that they had never done a hybrid project with 
                          both leaf-on and leaf-off. Shelby explained that he 
                          will be going to Dayton, Ohio, to review every roll 
                          of film with the vendor before anything is sent to the 
                          USGS. The reasons for this is to know what is being 
                          sent in and so that he can see the film in advance of 
                          any potential rejections for any circumstances. He explained 
                          that possible circumstances for rejection will be the 
                          leaf-on issue, the darkness, the lightness, and standing 
                          water in fields.</p>
                        <p>Shelby went on to describe that for the next year's 
                          flights, there are ten full rolls and two half rolls 
                          in the freezer at the vendor's office, and 20 rolls 
                          in the same batch reserved at Kodak. He said hat should 
                          be adequate to complete the entire state when photography 
                          is resumed. Shelby explained that they tried to move 
                          the flight window up with the NAPP program office to 
                          mid-December to end in March. After discussions, it 
                          was decided to resume flight on January 15 and to stop 
                          on March 31, 2001.</p>
                        <p>Shelby went over the proposed innovative partnership 
                          with the USGS to cover a portion of the NAPP processing 
                          cost. He said that he has not received any notice that 
                          the proposal has been accepted and furthermore, the 
                          USGS has responded through Ray Fox that they would not 
                          advance that proposal until they see some film. Additionally, 
                          there was a second arrangement in place that would be 
                          a workshare agreement with USGS where they would provide 
                          the existing DOQQs and the existing DEMs as a part of 
                          the processing and that was to have been taken care 
                          of in the first part of August. Shelby explained that 
                          the USGS has also withheld any action on that part of 
                          the project until they see some film.</p>
                        <p>Shelby said that the trip to Ohio will guide what film 
                          will be sent and that the issue is that once any film 
                          is sent to the USGS, it could take six months or twelve 
                          months to approve it and that delays the processing. 
                          The vendor is going to create diapositives of every 
                          piece of film and send that in so that the state is 
                          not constrained by the USGS QA/QC turnaround time. Doing 
                          this will put no limit on processing. DOQQs and DEMs 
                          still must be acquired, and Shelby explained that he 
                          has worked with Pam Smith of the NRCS and obtained copies 
                          of all the data they had for DOQQs, which has facilitated 
                          some processing. He said that the vendor still needs 
                          DOQQs outside the state borders.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that some DEM data has been acquired 
                          from Dr. Weih, but it still does not include enough 
                          outside the state borders. The USGS workshare agreement 
                          and their requirements to review film before releasing 
                          DEM data is a delay. Shelby said that he will try to 
                          get this resolved by going to Ohio where the film will 
                          be examined and choices will be made to send to the 
                          USGS. He said that probably the film of Lafayette County 
                          will be the first to be sent to the USGS. As soon as 
                          the DOQQ and DEM data is in place, the vendor then will 
                          have enough to process about 30 percent of what was 
                          flown last year.</p>
                        <p>Shelby commented that he is considering traveling to 
                          Reston with the vendor to give a very detailed and hands-on 
                          presentation about the status of the project to Jay 
                          Story, who is the NAPP program coordinator, so that 
                          when he presents the update to NAPP about the project, 
                          he will have everything he needs to know. Hopefully 
                          this will sway Mr. Story's support for the full amount 
                          of the funding that the Board has proposed. Shelby added 
                          that this all hinges on the film review in Ohio.</p>
                        <p>Shelby went on to say that later in August is the state 
                          mapping workshop and that is where all the states come 
                          in and interface with the National Mapping Division 
                          to talk about programs. One of the things that needs 
                          to be listened to is how they are dealing with other 
                          states to compare to Arkansas. One of the other opportunities 
                          is for the states to give feedback and Shelby, Learon 
                          and Bill Bush will gather facts and issues to give to 
                          Susan Lambert, the president of NSGIC. She will then 
                          take all the states' issues and present them to the 
                          USGS. Fred Limp commented that the National Mapping 
                          Division is undergoing a major reorganization that this 
                          might be part of the problem. Suzanne Wiley pointed 
                          out that the USGS at the top is pushing the new idea 
                          that states should take more responsibility in outsourcing 
                          and in using innovative technology, but on the bottom 
                          end they haven't figured out how to carry out this mandate.</p>
                        <p>Shelby explained that the vendor is very sensitive 
                          to the coordination between the state and USGS and feel 
                          it is very critical. He feels that they are going the 
                          extra mile to make sure to take care of Arkansas and 
                          that he is pleased with their efforts.</p>
                        <p><u>Corps of Engineers Project</u></p>
                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that the delivery schedule 
                          has been delayed for the high resolution photography 
                          data of the Arkansas River corridor for the Corps of 
                          Engineers. The final delivery should be by October 15. 
                          He has seen a sample of the data and said that the color 
                          photography is very good and the LIDAR data is excellent.</p>

                        <p>Shelby Johnson explained that there have been some 
                          phone calls and three meetings. There seems to be progress 
                          but no responses. He commented that the AHTD had authorized 
                          the bridge database. Shelby said that in his last meeting 
                          with the chief of the mapping section, Paul Edwards, 
                          they talked about the data that AHTD could contribute 
                          and that Mr. Edwards would coordinate that through their 
                          computer systems division.</p>
                        <p><u>Advisory Panel</u></p>
                        <p>There was discussion on the letters that have been 
                          sent, the RSVPs that have been returned for the scheduled 
                          Stakeholders Meeting on September 7, 2000, and the mailing 
                          of a followup letter for those who have not responded.</p>
                        <p>Suzanne Wiley discussed the new brochure and asked 
                          the members to check for any corrections before printing 
                          for the meeting.</p>

                          had met and worked out a draft agenda for the upcoming 
                          meeting. She asked the members to look at it and give 
                          their comments. She mentioned that Susan Cromwell was 
                          able to get John Lewis from the Bank of Fayetteville 
                          to give the visionary kickoff speech for the Stakeholders 
                          Meeting. Discussion followed regarding the agenda items 
                          and order of presentation. The members also discussed 
                          the presentation that is scheduled to be given before 
                          the GIS Users Forum on August 30.</p>
                        <p>Further discussion ensued regarding the logistics planning 
                          for the Stakeholders Meeting on September 7.</p>

                        <p>Susan Cromwell announced that on November 8th there 
                          will be another Technology Summit to be held in Little 
                          Rock and Governor Huckabee will be giving the keynote 
                          address. She explained that this will be a follow-up 
                          to the Summit held last year in November in Fayetteville 
                          where important technology issues were identified. </p>

                          to visit their agency, and the members discussed the 
                          possibility of doing this in October.</p>
