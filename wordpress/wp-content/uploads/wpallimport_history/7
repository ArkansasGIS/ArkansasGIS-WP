        <description>The Arkansas Historic District dataset contains the boundaries for all historic
                districts in Arkansas. The districts are formally designated through a process
                administered by the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program. These areas typically
                contain a concentration of buildings where half the structures are at least 50 years
                old and represent important elements of the areas. Property owners within the
                District may become eligible for federal tax credits through rehabilitation
                projects.The designation follows the process outlined below:The mayor or other
                representative of the interested city contacts the AHPP to express interest in the
                project.AHPP historians will visit the city to evaluate whether or not a sufficient
                concentration of historic structures exists to be designated a historic district.
                (Basically, at least 51 percent of the buildings must be 50 years or older and still
                reflect their historic appearance.)If a potential district exists, the AHPP will
                contact the city and provide a list of addresses for the buildings in the area that
                is eligible for district designation. The city or other local partners will generate
                the list of property owners.The AHPP will then work with the city to set a time and
                place for an informational meeting with property owners; the AHPP will mail letters
                to each of the property owners informing them of the meeting.At the meeting, AHPP
                representatives will explain the project, what is does and does not mean to be
                listed on the National Register, and how the 20 percent federal rehabilitation tax
                project works. Most questions and concerns about the project can be addressed at the
                meeting.After the meeting, the local partners will poll the property owners to
                determine whether or not at least 51 percent of them are interested in the historic
                district designation.After being notified that a majority of the owners are
                interested, the AHPP will contract an architectural resources survey of the district
                area, in which each building will be photographed and informational forms
                completed.At the completion of the survey, the AHPP will contract to have a National
                Register nomination completed for the district.When the nomination is completed, the
                AHPP will present it to its State Review Board, which meets the first Wednesday in
                April, August and December to make formal nominations to the National
                Register.Following the meeting, the nominations are sent to the Keeper of the
                National Register in Washington, D.C., who makes the final decision on whether a
                property is listed (The AHPP has a 99 percent success rate in this process).The
                decision on listing will be made within six weeks of delivery of the nomination to
                the Keeper.</description>
